  abstract = {Conservation biologists often ignore density dependence because at-risk populations are typically small relative to historical levels. However, if populations are reduced as a result of impacts that lower carrying capacity, then density-dependent mortality may exist at low population abundances. Here, we explore this issue in threatened populations of juvenile chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha). We followed the fate of more than 50 000 juvenile chinook in the Snake River Basin, USA to test the hypothesis that their survival was inversely associated with juvenile density. We also tested the hypotheses that non-indigenous brook trout and habitat quality affect the presence or strength of density dependence. Our results indicate that juvenile chinook suffer density-dependent mortality and the strength of density dependence was greater in streams in which brook trout were absent. We were unable to detect an effect of habitat quality on the strength of density dependence. Historical impacts of humans have greatly reduced population sizes of salmon, and the density dependence we report may stem from a shortage of nutrients normally derived from decomposing salmon carcasses. Cohorts of juvenile salmon may experience density-dependent mortality at population sizes far below historical levels and recovery of imperiled populations may be much slower than currently expected.},

  abstract = {Genetic markers are increasingly being used to ascertain the population of origin of individuals or mixtures of individuals in complex aggregations of Pacific salmon Oncorhynchus spp. Multilocus genotype data from singlenucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are especially useful for admixture analyses. Single-nucleotide polymorphisms can be discovered in nonmodel organisms with relative ease and can be characterized in the coding and regulatory regions of the genome influenced by selection. Those influenced by diversifying selection may show atypically high levels of differentiation among populations and thus be particularly valuable for genetic stock identification in cases where neutral loci show little difference among populations of interest. We identified four SNP loci from a panel of 42 as candidates for diversifying selection (referred to here as nonneutral SNPs) in sockeye salmon O. nerka from the Copper River and adjacent coastal drainages in south-central Alaska. We evaluated the information content of the four nonneutral loci for use in genetic stock identification and assessed their ability to improve the accuracy and precision of composition estimates. The average measure of informativeness for assignment (In) for neutral loci was 0.019, and the average In for nonneutral loci was 0.064. A simulation-based approach indicated that the addition of the nonneutral SNP loci to a neutral marker panel provided significantly higher resolution in the assignment of individuals to their populations of origin than would have been accomplished by adding an equal number of neutral loci. Nonneutral SNP loci improved the ability to identify the origin of individual fish and to estimate the composition of Pacific salmon populations in mixed fisheries.},

In natural populations, it is often difficult to collect adequate demographic data to calculate Ne directly. Consequently, genetic methods to estimate Ne have been developed. Two Ne estimators based on sibship reconstruction using multilocus genotype data have been developed in recent years: sibship assignment and parentage analysis without parents. In this study, we evaluated the accuracy of sibship reconstruction using a large empirical dataset from five hatchery steelhead populations with known pedigrees and using 95 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers. We challenged the software COLONY with 2,599,961 known relationships and demonstrated that reconstruction of full-\-sib and unrelated pairs was greater than 95\% and 99\% accurate, respectively. However, reconstruction of half-\-sib pairs was poor ({$<$}5\% accurate). Despite poor half-\-sib reconstruction, both estimators provided accurate estimates of the effective number of breeders (Nb) when sample sizes were near or greater than the true Nb and when assuming a monogamous mating system. We \-further demonstrated that both methods provide roughly equivalent estimates of Nb. Our results indicate that sibship reconstruction and current SNP panels provide \-promise for estimating Nb in steelhead populations in the region.},

Throughout the 54-d study, the 48 fish with transmitters in their stomachs (gastric fish) consistently grew more slowly than fish with surgically implanted transmitters (surgery fish), fish with surgery but no implanted transmitter (sham-surgery fish), or fish exposed only to handling (control fish). Growth rates of surgery fish were also slightly impaired at day 21, but by day 54 they were growing at rates comparable with those of control fish. Despite differences in growth, overall health was similar among all test fish. However, movement of the transmitter antenna caused abrasions at the corner of the mouth in all gastric fish, whereas only 22\% of the surgery fish had inflammation around the antenna exit wound. Feeding activity was similar among groups, but gastric fish exhibited a coughing behavior and appeared to have difficulty retaining swallowed food. Because growth and feeding behavior were less affected by the presence of surgically implanted transmitters than by gastric implants, we recommend surgically implanting transmitters for biotelemetry studies of juvenile chinook salmon between 114 and 159 mm fork length.},

In Brazil, the tambaqui is the most widely farmed native fish species. Despite this, there are no data on the pedigree of the farmed stocks, and the potential for interactions with wild populations in the Amazon basin has raised concerns with regard to the genetic variability of these stocks. The present study analysed sequences of the mitochondrial Control Region and 12 microsatellites to characterize the genetic variability of seven historically important commercial tambaqui breeding centres located in four different regions of Brazil, and compared these sequences with those obtained from individuals collected from a wild population. High levels of genetic diversity were found in the wild population, whereas genetic diversity was reduced in both markers in most captive populations, except for the broodstock located near the Amazon River. High FST and DEST indices were recorded between the wild population and most of the captive stocks analysed. The drastic reduction in genetic diversity found in most captive stocks and the difference between these stocks and the wild population may have been the result of the small size of the founding populations and the absence of breeding management. The renewal of the broodstocks and the application of breeding management techniques are recommended. In the Amazon region, in addition, the use of broodstocks that are genetically very different from local wild populations should be avoided.},

Genomic complexity reduction techniques such as sequence capture and restriction enzymebased methods enable the analysis of many more individuals per unit cost. Despite their utility, current complexity reduction methods have limitations, especially when large numbers of individuals are analyzed. Here we develop a much improved restriction site associated DNA (RAD) sequencing protocol and a new combinatorial method called Rapture (RAD capture). The new RAD protocol improves versatility by separating RAD tag isolation and sequencing library preparation into two distinct steps. This protocol also recovers more unique (non-clonal) RAD fragments and produces better data for both standard RAD and Rapture analysis. Rapture then uses an in-solution capture of chosen RAD tags to target sequencing reads to desired loci. Rapture combines the benefits of both RAD and sequence capture, i.e. very inexpensive and rapid library preparation for many individuals as well as high specificity in the number and location of genomic loci analyzed. Our results demonstrate that Rapture is a rapid and flexible technology capable of analyzing a very large number of individuals with minimal sequencing and library preparation cost. The methods presented here should improve the efficiency of genetic analysis for many aspects of agricultural, environmental, and biomedical science.},

Such conditions may also result from drought and water extraction. Our observations of humpback chub Gila cypha allowed us to test predicted impacts of increased water temperatures released from Glen Canyon Dam on this federally listed endangered cyprinid endemic to the Colorado River Basin. We modeled the potential that the young humpback chub we captured in 2006 and 2007 were hatched and reared up to 50 km upstream from the Little Colorado River, the natal origin of the majority of the humpback chub population below Glen Canyon Dam. Larval and adult humpback chub have been observed by others in our study reach in the post-dam era. Humpback chub assumed to be juveniles have been observed in our study area, but their ages were not confirmed. Our observations of humpback chub were coincident with not only increased water temperatures as a result of regional drought, but also decreasing rainbow trout population numbers and some constraints on dam release fluctuations. One or all of these factors could have contributed to increased survivorship of young humpback chub. The most parsimonious explanation for our observations was that the largest young humpback chub captured at our study site took advantage of warmer water temperatures to grow to one and two years of age. Continued favorable habitat conditions in this reach would likely support recruitment to adulthood and reproduction. Managers wish to increase the likelihood that a self-sustaining mainstem Colorado River population of humpback chub is established, distinct from the larger Little Colorado River population. Our results indicate that a separate population may be successfully established.},

Our objective was to determine if microsatellites previously developed for studies of burbot phylogeography could be multiplexed for effective PBT. A total of 14 microsatellite loci were multiplexed in four panels and tested for PBT efficacy in a hatchery population of burbot. An exclusion-based test involving 123 anonymous offspring and 51 known parent-pairs resulted in 97\% of the progeny assigning to the correct parents. Due to modest genetic diversity in the broodstock population, a high false-assignment rate (19\%) was observed when parental cross information was excluded from parentage analyses. While the existing set of burbot microsatellites can be multiplexed into effective panels for PBT, we recommend the development of additional microsatellite or single nucleotide polymorphism markers to improve exclusionary power.},

Through generations of interdependence with salmon, Indigenous Peoples developed sophisticated systems of management involving cultural and spiritual beliefs, and stewardship practices. Colonization radically altered these social\textendash ecological systems, disrupting Indigenous management, consolidating authority within colonial governments, and moving most harvest into mixed-stock fisheries. We review Indigenous management of salmon, including selective fishing technologies, harvest practices, and governance grounded in multigenerational place-based knowledge. These systems and practices showcase pathways for sustained productivity and resilience in contemporary salmon fisheries. Contrasting Indigenous systems with contemporary management, we document vulnerabilities of colonial governance and harvest management that have contributed to declining salmon fisheries in many locations. We suggest that revitalizing traditional systems of salmon management can improve prospects for sustainable fisheries and healthy fishing communities and identify opportunities for their resurgence.},

Sequential addition of the five highest rated SNPs to the suite of 14 microsatellites provided the equivalent average accuracy when compared with the current suite of microsatellites and MHC.

The northern squawfish Ptychocheilus oregonensis was the most abundant predator (estimated population: 85,316), followed by smallmouth bass Micropterus dolomieu (34,954) and walleye Stizostedion vitreum (15,168). Because of uncertainty in sampling and assumptions of the mark-recapture estimator, the combined abundance of these three predators could lie between 50,000 and 500,000. We believe, however, that bias is probably negative, and that any errors should result in conservative estimates. Northern squawfish were common reservoir-wide, but large concentrations occurred immediately below McNary Dam near the head of John Day Reservoir. Walleyes were largely restricted to the upper third of the reservoir, whereas the number of smallmouth bass increased progressively downriver. As judged by abundance and distribution, northern squawfish have by far the greatest potential for predation on juvenile salmonids. We also expect predation to be unevenly distributed in time and space as a result of variations in the number and distribution of predators.},

  abstract = {Off-channel areas are one of the most impacted aquatic habitats by humans globally, as extensive agricultural and urban development has limited them to roughly 10\% of historical extent. This is also true for California's Sacramento River Valley, where historically frequent widespread inundation has been reduced to a few off-channel water bodies along the mid-Sacramento River. This remaining shallow-water habitat provides crucial ecological benefits to multiple avian and fish species, but especially to floodplain-adapted species such as Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha). Characterizing spatiotemporal off-channel dynamics, including inundation extent and residence time, is fundamental to better understanding the intrinsic value of such habitats and their potential to support recovery actions. Remote sensing techniques have been increasingly used to map surface water at regional and local scales, with improved resolutions. As such, this study maps off-channel inundation areas and describes their temporal dynamics by analyzing pixel-based timeseries of multiple water indices, modified Normalized Difference Water Index (mNDWI) and the Automated Water Extraction Index (AWEI), generated from LandSat-8 and Sentinel-2 data between 2013\textendash 2021. Quantified off-channel area was similar with each water index and method used, but improved performance was associated with Sentinel-2 products and AWEI index to identify wetted areas under lower mainstem discharges. Results indicate an uneven distribution of off-channel habitat in the study area, with limited inundated areas in upstream reaches ({$<$}16\% of total off-channel area for greater flows). In addition, much less habitat exists for flows under 400 m3/s, an important migration cue for endangered winter-run Chinook salmon, limiting juvenile access to areas with enhanced rearing conditions. Off-channel habitat residence times averaged between 7 and 16 days, primarily defined by the rate of receding flows, with rapid flow recession providing marginal off-channel habitat. This study shows reasonable performance of moderate resolution LandSat-8 and Sentinel-2 remote sensing imagery to characterize shallow-water inundated habitat in higher-order rivers, and as a method to inform restoration and native fish recovery efforts.},

We detected Yellowstone Cutthroat Trout in all but one site despite significant historical stocking of Rainbow Trout O. mykiss. Three of four relatively low-elevation sites near the reservoir contained Yellowstone Cutthroat Trout in sympatry with early-generation hybrids and Rainbow Trout yet contained no physical barriers to admixture. A posteriori assignment tests suggested that migrants from a nearby headwater population in Ross Fork Creek and possibly recruitment by local-origin Yellowstone Cutthroat Trout with fluvial or adfluvial life histories drive persistence in these sites. In contrast, hybridization was rare or absent in headwater populations and was associated with complete or apparent physical isolation. We also compared genetic diversity of our samples with Yellowstone basin Yellowstone Cutthroat Trout and Bear River Bonneville Cutthroat Trout O. c. utah to examine possible historical gene flow resulting from hydrogeological connections during the Pleistocene. Multivariate analysis showed that most genetic variation among individuals was explained by divergence of Yellowstone basin Yellowstone Cutthroat Trout from our samples and Bear River Bonneville Cutthroat Trout, which supports recent mtDNA studies and a possible change in taxonomic nomenclature. Our results indicate that, due to relative isolation and downstream emigration, headwater populations are critical to the persistence of Yellowstone Cutthroat Trout and thus loss of such populations would likely threaten the subspecies throughout the region. Management actions to reduce threats from established, nonnative Rainbow Trout populations will likely have to be multifaceted and may include a combination of targeted removal of Rainbow Trout and hybrids and the use of physical barriers to prevent further dispersal.},

Subsequent efforts throughout the Columbia River basin (CRB) have attempted to restore habitats altered through land development to recover imperiled salmon populations. However, there is scant evidence for demographic change in salmon populations following restoration. We used a process-based approach to estimate the potential benefit of floodplain reconnection throughout the CRB to Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) parr. Using satellite imagery, we measured stream habitats at 2093 CRB stream reaches to construct random forest models of habitat based on geomorphic and regional characteristics. Connected floodplain width was the most important factor for determining side channel presence. We estimated a current CRB-wide decrease in side channel habitat area of 26\% from historical conditions. Reconnection of historical floodplains currently used for agriculture could increase side channel habitat by 25\% and spring Chinook salmon parr total rearing capacity by 9\% over current estimates. Individual watersheds vary greatly in habitat factors that limit salmon recovery, and large-scale estimates of restoration potential like these are needed to make decisions about long-term restoration goals among imperiled populations.},

  abstract = {Big Bear Creek in the Potlatch River system, Idaho, contains an Endangered Species Act-listed wild population of steelhead Oncorhynchus mykiss (anadromous Rainbow Trout) that is the focus of extensive habitat restoration actions intended to increase population abundance. Both anadromous and resident O. mykiss populations occur in the Big Bear Creek drainage; however, anadromous individuals are known to spawn and rear only in the lower drainage, whereas putative resident fish occur in the headwaters. Big Bear Falls is a potential upstream migration barrier that is located between the two populations. Oncorhynchus mykiss of unknown origin are present within 1 km above the falls. We used analyses of genetic diversity, structure, and sibship reconstruction to determine whether Big Bear Falls limited the movement of steelhead to headwater areas. Known resident O. mykiss were sampled in headwater areas, known anadromous adults were sampled at a weir in the lower drainage, and juveniles of unknown life history were collected from areas below and above the falls. Allele frequency data indicated that anadromous and headwater resident populations were highly differentiated and that exchange of genetic material between populations was limited. However, juvenile O. mykiss in the above-waterfall collection were found to be the offspring or recent descendants of steelhead that successfully navigated above Big Bear Falls, demonstrating that the falls is not a complete barrier. We also identified evidence of limited downstream gene flow, suggesting that resident fish contributed genetic material to the downstream anadromous population. This study documented the successful passage of adult steelhead above Big Bear Falls and the downstream movement of resident fish from the headwaters. However, uncertainties still exist regarding the annual variability in passage and the habitat limitations that impact O. mykiss utilization of areas immediately above the falls.},

  abstract = {Anadromous Chinook salmon populations vary in the period of river entry at the initiation of adult freshwater migration, facilitating optimal arrival at natal spawning. Run timing is a polygenic trait that shows evidence of rapid parallel evolution in some lineages, signifying a key role for this phenotype in the ecological divergence between populations. Studying the genetic basis of local adaptation in quantitative traits is often impractical in wild populations. Therefore, we used a novel approach, Random Forest, to detect markers linked to run timing across 14 populations from contrasting environments in the Columbia River and Puget Sound, USA. The approach permits detection of loci of small effect on the phenotype. Divergence between populations at these loci was then examined using both principle component analysis and FST outlier analyses, to determine whether shared genetic changes resulted in similar phenotypes across different lineages. Sequencing of 9107 RAD markers in 414 individuals identified 33 predictor loci explaining 79.2\% of trait variance. Discriminant analysis of principal components of the predictors revealed both shared and unique evolutionary pathways in the trait across different lineages, characterized by minor allele frequency changes. However, genome mapping of predictor loci also identified positional overlap with two genomic outlier regions, consistent with selection on loci of large effect. Therefore, the results suggest selective sweeps on few loci and minor changes in loci that were detected by this study. Use of a polygenic framework has provided initial insight into how divergence in a trait has occurred in the wild.},

  abstract = {This report summarizes the abundance, composition, and productivity of wild juvenile steelhead and yearling and subyearling Chinook Salmon emigrating past Lower Granite Dam, migratory years 2010-2017.We used systematic biological samples from the Juvenile Fish Facility to decompose each species by origin, age, sex, and genetic stock. Steelhead juvenile emigration averaged 830,679 and ranged from 672,883 to 928,701 fish. Genetic stock abundance followed a general pattern with the Grande Ronde having the highest abundance (17-24\%) in all years followed by the Upper Salmon (14-22\%). The South Fork Salmon (2-7\%) and Lower Salmon (2-5\%) were the least abundant and the remaining genetic stocks (Middle Fork Salmon, Upper Clearwater, South Fork Clearwater, Lower Clearwater, Imnaha, and Lower Snake) fluctuated between years. Depending on the year, 4 to 5 freshwater age classes were observed with the vast majority of emigrants comprised of freshwater age-2 and age-3 fish. Genetic stock typically having large ({$\geq$}78 cm) returning adults had higher proportions of freshwater age-3 juveniles than other genetic stocks. Sex ratios were female biased (54-67\%) for the aggregate juvenile emigration. However, sex ratios by genetic stock were not biased towards either sex in most years, but were skewed towards female when biased. Juvenile per parent productivity was complete for the aggregate and individual genetic stocks for brood years 2009-2012 and ranged from 13-47 juveniles per parent. Brood year 2009 had the highest productivity and brood year 2011 had the lowest. Yearling Chinook Salmon juvenile emigration averaged 1,202,436 and ranged from 601,722 to 1,712,102 fish. Genetic stock abundance followed a general pattern of the Hells Canyon having the highest abundance (32-40\%) in all years, while Fall (0-2\%) and Tucannon (0-1\%) were the least abundant. The remaining genetic stocks (Upper Salmon, Middle Fork Salmon, South Fork Salmon, and Chamberlain) fluctuated in proportion between years. Sex ratios were female biased (54-56\%) for the aggregate juvenile emigration in all years except 2011 and 2015. However, sex ratios were not statistically biased in most years for each genetic stock. Juvenile per parent productivity was estimated for brood years 2010-2015 and updated the time series starting in brood year 1990. The aggregate juvenile productivity ranged from 28-403 juveniles per female. The most recent complete brood years were on the lower end of the observed range. A Beverton-Holt stock-recruit model computed intrinsic productivity to be 405 juveniles per female and asymptotic production was 1.40 million natural juveniles. Subyearling Chinook Salmon juvenile emigration was analyzed for migration years 2010-2014. Emigration estimates for all subyearling Chinook averaged 2,376,104 fish and ranged from 1,324,581 to 3,390,860 fish. The Fall genetic stock comprised 87-97\% of the overall emigration abundance of subyearling Chinook. Sex ratios were not biased towards either sex. Sampling for subyearling Chinook Salmon was discontinued after migration year 2014 due to the lack of the target spring/summer Chinook in the sample and logistics. Productivity was not calculated for subyearling Chinook Salmon. This report is the second attempt at a stock assessment using genetic stock identification, but the first using a hierarchical compositional analysis (SCRAPI) for natural juvenile emigration from the Snake River steelhead DPS and spring/summer Chinook ESU. Estimates within this report supersede previous estimates covering the same migration years. The ultimate goal of this program is to develop productivity relationships at various population levels. Data provided here are essential to understanding productivity and diversity of the emigrating life stages.},

  abstract = {Assessments of threatened wild Snake River steelhead Oncorhynchus mykiss have historically been limited due to a lack of stock-specific information and difficulties in field sampling efforts. We used genetic stock identification (GSI) to estimate the composition of wild adult steelhead migrating past Lower Granite Dam on the Snake River between August 24 and November 25, 2008. Further, we combined genetic data with information on sex, length, age, and run timing to examine for differences in life history or demography among stocks. In total, 1,087 samples collected at the dam were genotyped with 13 standardized steelhead microsatellite loci and a new modified Y-chromosome-specific assay that differentiates sex. A genetic baseline of 66 populations was used to complete GSI of unknown-origin samples from Lower Granite Dam. Large differences in reporting group (stock) contributions were observed for the run as a whole; the Snake River\textendash lower Clearwater River reporting group had the largest single contribution of 36.1\% (95\% confidence interval [CI] = 30.2\textendash 39.7\%). Other large contributions were 15.4\% (12.8\textendash 18.7\%) from the upper Clearwater River reporting group and 13.9\% (12.5\textendash 18.7\%) from the lower Salmon River reporting group. Smaller contributions came from the other six reporting groups (Imnaha River: mean = 9.5\%, 95\% CI = 6.8\textendash 13.6\%; upper Salmon River: 9.2\%, 5.1\textendash 11.3\%; South Fork Clearwater River: 7.6\%, 4.3\textendash 8.9\%; Middle Fork Salmon River: 5.1\%, 3.5\textendash 6.4\%; South Fork Salmon River: 2.7\%, 1.3\textendash 3.6\%; Elk Creek: 0.5\%, 0.0\textendash 1.2\%). Significant differences in reporting group contributions were observed when samples were grouped according to length, age, and run timing differences. Of the samples analyzed, 372 (34.9\%) were identified as males and 694 (65.1\%) were identified as females. Our results demonstrate that the GSI methodologies applied to Snake River steelhead have the potential of providing an efficient, minimally intrusive tool for obtaining stock-specific abundance of this threatened distinct population segment. This technology can assist future viability status assessments of Snake River steelhead by contributing to refinements in population delineations, productivity calculations, and annual stock-specific estimation of life history characteristics (e.g., age structure, sex ratio, and run timing).},

This method uses only unlabelled oligos and PCR master mix in two thermal cycling steps for amplification of targeted SNP loci. During this process, sequencing adapters and dual barcode sequence tags are incorporated into the amplicons enabling thousands of individuals to be pooled into a single sequencing library. Post sequencing, reads from individual samples are split into individual files using their unique combination of barcode sequences. Genotyping is performed with a simple perl script which counts amplicon-specific sequences for each allele, and allele ratios are used to determine the genotypes. We demonstrate this technique by genotyping 2068 individual steelhead trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) samples with a set of 192 SNP markers in a single library sequenced in a single Illumina HiSeq lane. Genotype data were 99.9\% concordant to previously collected TaqManTM genotypes at the same 192 loci, but call rates were slightly lower with GT-seq (96.4\%) relative to Taqman (99.0\%). Of the 192 SNPs, 187 were genotyped in {$\geq$}90\% of the individual samples and only 3 SNPs were genotyped in {$<$}70\% of samples. This study demonstrates amplicon sequencing with GTseq greatly reduces the cost of genotyping hundreds of targeted SNPs relative to existing methods by utilizing a simple library preparation method and massive efficiency of scale.},

  abstract = {Environmental DNA (eDNA) is DNA that has been released by an organism into its environment, such that the DNA can be found in air, water, or soil. In aquatic systems, eDNA has been shown to provide a sampling approach that is more sensitive for detecting target organisms faster, and less expensively than previous approaches. However, eDNA needs to be sampled in a manner that has been tested and found effective and, because single copies of target DNA are detected reliably, rigorous procedures must be designed to avoid sample contamination. Here we provide the details of a sampling protocol designed for detecting fish. This protocol, or very similar prototypes, has been used to collect data reported in multiple peerreviewed journal articles and from more than 5,000 additional samples at the time of publication. This process has been shown to be exceedingly sensitive and no case of field contamination has been detected. Over time, we have refined the process to make it more convenient. Our policy at the National Genomics Center for Wildlife and Fish Conservation is to provide collaborators with kits that contain all of the materials necessary to properly collect and store eDNA samples. Although the instructions in this protocol assume that the collaborator will have this same equipment, we also describe how users can create their own kit, and where we think there is flexibility in the equipment used.},

We applied the model to investigate the role of lateral habitat, stream morphological complexity, water use, and temperature regimes on aquatic habitat quality distribution of juvenile Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) within the Lemhi River (eastern Idaho, USA). Modeling results showed two key aspects: (i) a reduction in diverted flows is not sufficient to improve habitat quality potentially because of a legacy of morphological simplification (directly due to straightening and wood removal and indirectly due to low in-channel flows) and (ii) morphological complexity and connectivity with side channels and margin areas, which are key and vital elements to support suitable habitats that meet or exceed energetic needs to sustain or promote growth of individuals and populations.},

  abstract = {Over the last century, Chinook Salmon Oncorhynchus tshawytscha populations in the Pacific Northwest have experienced dramatic declines, leading to many of them being listed as threatened under the Endangered Species Act. The abundance of these threatened populations relative to the thresholds for delisting remains the primary metric for assessing recovery, yet determining the true population abundances from multiple survey types with unknown levels of accuracy and precision remains difficult. The abundance of the spring\textendash summer Chinook Salmon population in Johnson Creek, Idaho, has been measured using a mark\textendash recapture survey and three different redd count surveys (RCSs) that vary temporally and spatially. Using a state-space model, we determined the accuracy and precision of each survey type by decoupling the observation error of the survey from the process error describing the annual variability in the true population abundance. We then extended the results of the model to determine the risk of managers' incorrectly delisting the population (a type I error) or incorrectly keeping it listed (a type II error). Finally, we show that salmon managers with data-limited populations (primarily those with only single-pass index RCSs) might use the results of our risk analysis to determine whether expanding survey efforts to minimize management risks is appropriate when they are confronted with dwindling financial resources. For example, we determined that although both the multiple-pass extended RCS (CV = 0.06) and mark\textendash recapture surveys (CV = 0.14) provide unbiased estimates of salmon abundance in Johnson Creek, the mark\textendash recapture study can have annual costs that are 30\textendash 100 times greater. Managers may determine that directing research funds toward acquiring information unique to weir-based mark\textendash recapture surveys (i.e., migration timing, good genetics samples, etc.) may not be justified for all populations.},

  abstract = {Rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss Walbaum) in southern Western Australia have undergone passive selection for over 19 generations to survive high water temperatures. Based on the conceptual model of `oxygen- and capacity-limited thermal tolerance', we measured critical thermal maximum (CTmax), maximum heart rate ( fH,max) and aerobic scope to test the hypothesis that these rainbow trout can maintain aerobic scope at high temperatures through a robust cardiac performance supporting oxygen delivery. Across five family groups CTmax averaged 29.0{$\pm$}0.02\textdegree C. Aerobic scope was maximized at 15.8{$\pm$}0.3\textdegree C (Topt), while the upper pejus temperature (Tpej, set at 90\% of maximum aerobic scope) was 19.9{$\pm$}0.3\textdegree C. Although aerobic scope decreased at temperatures above Topt, the value at 25\textdegree C remained well over 40\% of the maximum. Furthermore, pharmacologically stimulated fH,max increased with temperature, reaching a peak value between 23.5{$\pm$}0.4 and 24.0{$\pm$}0.4\textdegree C (Tmax) for three family groups. The Arrhenius breakpoint temperature (TAB) for fH,max was 20.3{$\pm$}0.3 to 20.7{$\pm$}0.4\textdegree C, while the average Q10 breakpoint temperature (TQB, when the incremental Q10{$<$}1.6) for fH,max was 21.6{$\pm$}0.2 to 22.0{$\pm$}0.4\textdegree C. Collectively, fH,max progressively became less temperature dependent beyond 20\textdegree C (TAB and TQB), which coincides with the upper Tpej for aerobic scope. Although upper thermal performance indices for both aerobic scope and fH,max were compared among family groups in this population, appreciable differences were not evident. Compared with other populations of rainbow trout, the present assessment is consistent with the prediction that this strain has undergone selection and shows the ability to tolerate higher water temperatures.},

  abstract = {Despite the popularity of barrier removal as a habitat restoration technique, there are few studies that evaluate the biological effects of restored stream crossings. An extensive post-treatment study design was used to quantify fish populations (e.g. species, life stage, abundance) and habitat attributes (e.g. gradient, geomorphic channel units) at 32 culvert removal or replacement projects to determine their effectiveness in restoring habitat access for juvenile salmon, Oncorhynchus spp., and steelhead, O. mykiss (Walbaum), in the Columbia River Basin, USA. Anadromous fish (steelhead, Chinook salmon O. tshawytscha [Walbaum]) abundance, juvenile steelhead abundance and habitat conditions were not significantly different between paired reaches (i.e. upstream and downstream of former barrier sites), suggesting these sites are no longer full barriers to movement. This suggests that barrier removal projects on small Columbia Basin streams provide adequate fish passage, increased habitat availability and increased juvenile anadromous fish abundance immediately upstream of former barriers.},

  abstract = {Chinook Salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) is an economically and ecologically important species, and populations from the west coast of North America are a major component of fisheries in the North Pacific Ocean. The anadromous life history strategy of this species generates populations (or stocks) that typically are differentiated from neighboring populations. In many cases, it is desirable to discern the stock of origin of an individual fish or the stock composition of a mixed sample to monitor the stock-specific effects of anthropogenic impacts and alter management strategies accordingly. Genetic stock identification (GSI) provides such discrimination, and we describe here a novel GSI baseline composed of genotypes from more than 8000 individual fish from 69 distinct populations at 96 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) loci. The populations included in this baseline represent the likely sources for more than 99\% of the salmon encountered in ocean fisheries of California and Oregon. This new genetic baseline permits GSI with the use of rapid and cost-effective SNP genotyping, and power analyses indicate that it provides very accurate identification of important stocks of Chinook Salmon. In an ocean fishery sample, GSI assignments of more than 1000 fish, with our baseline, were highly concordant (98.95\%) at the reporting unit level with information from the physical tags recovered from the same fish. This SNP baseline represents an important advance in the technologies available to managers and researchers of this species.},

Fin ray age had an overall accuracy of 98.6\% and was unbiased (v2 {$\frac{1}{4}$} 2.00; P {$\frac{1}{4}$} 0.34). Precision of fin ray readings was higher than that of scale readings (coefficient of variation {$\frac{1}{4}$} 2.1\% versus 7.8\%, respectively). Accuracy of fin ray ages was greater than that of scale ages (Z {$\frac{1}{4}$} 2.198; P {$\frac{1}{4}$} 0.03). For two age composition scenarios, age classification errors were greatest when using scales and least when using fin rays. Aging errors inflated the size of weak cohorts in simulated run reconstructions. We showed how this can cause large errors in estimates of smolt-to-adult return rate when run strength and age composition vary among years. The amount of error associated with scale aging then becomes problematic for tracking the status of both threatened and healthy salmon stocks. Data based on fin ray readings provided the most accurate, unbiased estimates of age structure. Correction for methodological bias is important if age data are to be used in rigorous analyses.},

As initial abundance increased, higher proportions of juveniles adopted the age-1 smolt phenotype or emigrated as fall parr. The age-0 smolt phenotype had the highest relative survival, and the fall parr phenotype, the lowest. The contributions of each emigrant type to cohort smolt production varied with circumstances; hence, the full expression of phenotypic diversity is important to the study population.

  abstract = {The existence of multiple migration tactics within a population has been observed for several fish species, and they may contribute differentially to adult recruitment. Relative contribution by juveniles using the same habitats on different schedules is variable; therefore, understanding and conserving this diversity should be important to fisheries managers. We investigated adult recruitment by two distinct juvenile migration tactics in several spawning populations of stream-type Chinook Salmon Oncorhynchus tshawytscha in Idaho: those leaving the spawning grounds as subyearlings during June through November (downstream rearing, or DSR, type) and those emigrating from natal areas 1 year after emergence (natal reach rearing, or NRR, type). The DSR type had greater juvenile abundance in all populations, although the NRR type exhibited better survival from the natal reach to the migratory corridor. The DSR type had greater survival from smoltification to adult return to freshwater compared with the NRR type. More DSR emigrants than NRR emigrants returned to freshwater as adults, although the difference was influenced by cohort and population. Adult recruits to stream-type Chinook Salmon populations in Idaho are comprised mostly of DSR emigrants, i.e., fish that dispersed from their natal habitats and reared in reaches downstream. This finding is ubiquitous, although the size of the effect depends on cohort and population. We demonstrated that juvenile Chinook Salmon in Idaho do indeed use downstream rearing habitats effectively, thereby increasing recruitment of adults back to the spawning gravels in these populations. This study illustrates how dispersive life histories are essential to achieve the full productive potential of migratory stream fish populations.},

  abstract = {Grouping populations for management may overlook the fine-scale diversity underpinning the stability and resilience of meta-populations and fisheries. A bimodal timing distribution of summer-run steelhead Oncorhynchus mykiss (anadromous Rainbow Trout) historically was observed at Bonneville Dam (BON), the first barrier to upstream migration in the Columbia River basin. Early mode fish (A-run) tended to be younger and smaller ({$<$}78 cm) than later fish (B-run). While A-run fish spawn throughout the Columbia River basin, B-run fish spawn primarily in the Snake River basin. Managers used indices of these modes to make fishery decisions, and later these criteria were adopted for conservation. It is still unclear how life history and body size differences among wild Snake River populations are related to the categories at BON. We examined population parameters characterizing the two categories (date of passage at BON, length) and parameters directly affecting population dynamics (age composition, sex ratio). The life history portfolio of Snake River steelhead is quite diverse. There was broad overlap among populations in several respects, forming a gradient in life history characteristics rather than a dichotomous break. All populations produced adults {$<$}78 cm and adults returning after August 25. Median lengths of putative B-run populations were close to the criterion that was supposed to be a defining characteristic. In contrast, few A-run populations produced many adults {$\geq$}78 cm. Mean percentage of two-ocean fish was 52.1\% for A-run populations and 82.0\% for B-run populations. Mean age at spawn was greater in populations producing older smolts. Sex ratio was female biased, and older populations had greater percentages of females. Although the runtype dichotomy was useful for management of fisheries in the past, it is not useful for conservation. A combination of genetic stock identification at main-stem dams and population-specific monitoring in natal streams provides a unified framework for the assessment of fisheries management and conservation objectives.},

The balance of factors affecting survival between spawns and fecundity of repeat spawners should determine the percentage of iteroparous individuals in a population. Steelhead Oncorhynchus mykiss are capable of iteroparity, but Snake River populations in the interior Columbia River basin in the Pacific Northwest have the lowest iteroparity rates. Managers are interested in augmenting the incidence of iteroparity as a conservation measure. However, there is little information about repeat-spawning steelhead to guide and evaluate management. In this study, we elucidated patterns and characteristics of repeat-spawning steelhead in the Snake River basin. Repeat spawners were overwhelmingly female and were found in all 10 stocks. Most iteroparous fish first spawned after 1 year in the ocean (51.4\%) and skipped a year between spawns (55.4\%). Growth between spawns declined for longer, older steelhead. Survival from the first spawning migration to postspawn emigration increased during the study. However, survival in the Columbia River estuary and Pacific Ocean declined such that overall survival to second spawn varied little. Small females were most likely to survive to a second spawning migration. We hypothesized that iteroparity in Snake River steelhead was constrained by the energetic costs of the spawning migration (distance, elevation, timing, dam passage) combined with a lack of timely postspawn recovery. Hence, survival to second spawning migration is low for Snake River steelhead and most postspawn steelhead needed a full year to recover. Management programs intended to augment the incidence of iteroparity should account for (1) factors that increase stress and metabolic demand on spawning and postspawn fish and (2) factors that increase the time it takes for emigrating kelts to effectively refuel and recover.},

Although small-scale benefits of stream habitat restoration are commonly investigated, it is difficult to demonstrate population effects. The Pahsimeroi River Chinook salmon Oncorhynchus tshawytscha population was previously restricted to the lower portion of the river by multiple irrigation structures. To address fish passage issues, a combination of restoration projects was initiated including barrier removals, instream flow enhancements and installation of fish screens on diversions. The largest barrier was removed in 2009, more than doubling the amount of accessible linear habitat. We hypothesized restoration efforts would expand the distribution of spawning salmon in the Pahsimeroi River watershed, leading to a broader distribution of juveniles. We also hypothesized a broader juvenile distribution would have population effects by reducing the prevalence of densitydependent growth and survival. Redds were documented in newly accessible habitat immediately following barrier removal and accounted for a median of 42\% of all redds in the Pahsimeroi River watershed during 2009\textendash 2015. Snorkel surveys also documented juvenile rearing in newly accessible habitat. Juvenile productivity increased from a median of 64 smolts/female spawner for brood years 2002\textendash 2008 to 99 smolts/female spawner for brood years 2009\textendash 2014. Overall, results suggested increased habitat accessibility in the Pahsimeroi River broadened the distribution of spawning adult and rearing juvenile salmon and reduced the effects of densitydependent survival. Large-scale stream restoration efforts can have a population effect. Despite the large-scale effort and response, habitat restoration alone is likely not sufficient to restore this population.},

The aim of this study was to compare accuracies of breeding value predictions obtained with pedigree-based best linear unbiased prediction (P-BLUP) methodology against different genomic prediction approaches: genomic BLUP (G-BLUP), Bayesian Lasso, and Bayes C. To achieve this, 2404 individuals from 118 families were measured for C. rogercresseyi count after a challenge and genotyped using 37 K single nucleotide polymorphisms. Accuracies were assessed using fivefold cross-validation and SNP densities of 0.5, 1, 5, 10, 25 and 37 K. Accuracy of genomic predictions increased with increasing SNP density and was higher than pedigree-based BLUP predictions by up to 22\%. Both Bayesian and G-BLUP methods can predict breeding values with higher accuracies than pedigree-based BLUP, however, G-BLUP may be the preferred method because of reduced computation time and ease of implementation. A relatively low marker density (i.e. 10 K) is sufficient for maximal increase in accuracy when using G-BLUP or Bayesian methods for genomic prediction of C. rogercresseyi resistance in Atlantic salmon.},

Otolith microchemistry (87Sr/86Sr) techniques were used to determine the maternal life history (resident or anadromous) of 498 emigrating steelhead kelts in the Yakima Basin, Washington. Five geochemically distinct freshwater rearing regions were identified within the basin. All five regions were predicted to produce steelhead with resident maternal life histories. Basin-wide, 20\% and 7\% of steelhead collected in 2010 and 2011, respectively, had resident maternal life histories. Cross-life-history form production may be critical to persistence of anadromous life histories within partially anadromous salmonid populations, particularly in areas where anadromous fish abundance is low due to natural or anthropogenic influences.},

  abstract = {This paper reviews the habitat characteristics and the behaviour of selected stream fishes during winter in temperate\textendash boreal ecosystems. Emphasis is placed on the salmonid fishes upon which most winter research has been directed. As space is the primary factor regulating stream fish populations in winter, aspects of winter habitat are considered at various spatial scales from microhabitat to stream reach to river basin. Choice of winter habitat is governed by the need to minimize energy expenditure, with the main criterion being protection from adverse physicochemical conditions (e.g., ice, spates, low oxygen). The distance moved to wintering habitats, and the continued activity by many fishes during winter, need to be considered when making management decisions regarding fish habitat. How habitat is affected by land-use activity in stream catchments is discussed with reference to impacts from water withdrawal, varying discharge regimes, and erosion or sedimentation. Even stream ``enhancement'' practices can deleteriously affect fish habitat if project managers are unaware of winter habitat requirements and stream conditions. Maintenance of habitat complexity, at least at the scale of stream sub-basin, is recommended to ensure the diversity of winter habitats for fish communities.},

Where multiple populations are harvested together, run reconstruction methods partition mixed-stock catches and allocate recruits back to their populations of origin. Traditional run reconstruction methods often use age composition data to inform catch partitioning. However age-only methods do not account for stock-specific differences in the availability of fish to harvest within fishing areas or the incidental harvest of nontarget stocks in nearby fishing areas. Advances in molecular genetic techniques permit genetic stock identification (GSI) of both contemporary and historical catch samples. We present a statistical model for salmon run reconstruction that utilizes both age composition and GSI data to estimate differences in the availability of stocks within, and interception rates among, terminal fisheries. When applied to the commercial sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka) fishery in Bristol Bay, Alaska, new estimates of population productivity differed from those generated using previous age-only methods by 0.1\%\textendash 155.1\%, with stock-specific mean absolute percent differences of 9.7\%\textendash 38.7\% across years, underscoring the value of genetic data for run reconstruction. With more accurate run reconstruction methods, spawner\textendash recruit relationships can be identified more precisely, thus providing more accurate management targets for salmon fisheries.},

  abstract = {Extensive individual variation in spatial behaviour is a common feature among species that exhibit migratory life cycles. Nowhere is this more evident than in salmonid fishes; individual fish may complete their entire life cycle in freshwater streams, others may migrate variable distances at sea and yet others limit their migrations to larger rivers or lakes before returning to freshwater streams to spawn. This review presents evidence that individual variation in migratory behaviour and physiology in salmonid fishes is controlled by developmental thresholds and that part of the variation in proximal traits activating the development of alternative migratory tactics is genetically based. We summarize evidence that alternative migratory tactics co-exist within populations and that all individuals may potentially adopt any of the alternative phenotypes. Even though intra-specific genetic divergence of migratory tactics is uncommon, it may occur if female competition for oviposition sites results in spawning segregation of alternative phenotypes. Because of their polygenic nature, alternative migratory tactics are considered as threshold traits. Threshold traits have two characteristics: an underlying 'liability' trait that varies in a continuous fashion, and a threshold value which is responsible for the discreetness observed in phenotypic distribution. We review evidence demonstrating that body size is an adequate proxy for the liability trait controlling the decision to migrate, but that the same phenotypic outcome (anadromy or residency) may be reached by different developmental pathways. The evidence suggesting a significant heritable component in the development of alternative migratory tactics is subsequently reviewed, leading us to conclude that alternative migratory tactics have considerable potential to respond to selection and evolve. We review what is known about the proximal physiological mechanisms mediating the translation of the continuous value of the liability trait into a discontinuous migratory tactic. We conclude by identifying several avenues for future research, including testing the frequency-dependent selection hypothesis, establishing the relative importance of adaptive phenotypic plasticity in explaining some geographic gradients in migratory behaviour and identifying the physiological and genetic basis of the switching mechanisms responsible for alternative migratory tactics.},

  abstract = {Quantifying geomorphic conditions that impact riverine ecosystems is critical in river management due to degraded riverine habitat, changing flow and thermal conditions, and increasing anthropogenic pressure. Geomorphic complexity at different scales directly impacts habitat heterogeneity and affects aquatic biodiversity resilience. Here we showed that the combination of continuous spatial survey at high resolution, topobathymetric light detection and ranging (LiDAR), and continuous wavelet analysis can help identify and characterize that complexity. We used a continuous wavelet analysis on 1-m resolution topobathymetry in three rivers in the Salmon River Basin, Idaho (USA), to identify different scales of topographic variability and the potential effects of this variability on salmonid redd site selection. On each river, wavelet scales characterized the topographic variability by portraying repeating patterns in the longitudinal profile. We found three major representative spatial wavelet scales of topographic variability in each river: a small wavelet scale associated with local morphology such as pools and riffles, a mid-wavelet scale that identified larger channel unit features, and a large wavelet scale related to valley-scale controls. The small wavelet scale was used to identify pools and riffles along the entire lengths of each river as well as areas with differing riffle-pool development. Areas along the rivers with high local topographic variability (high wavelet power) at all wavelet scales contained the largest features (i.e., deepest or longest pools) in the systems. By comparing the wavelet power for each wavelet scale to Chinook salmon redd locations, we found that higher small-scale wavelet power, which is related to pool-riffle topography, is important for redd site selection. The continuous wavelet methodology objectively identified scales of topographic variability present in these rivers, performed efficient channel-unit identification, and provided geomorphic assessment without laborious field surveys.},

Paternity of 270 veined squid (Loligo forbesi) hatchlings from three egg strings collected from one location was assigned using five microsatellite loci. Paternal and maternal genotypes reconstructed for each of the three strings were identical, strongly indicating that a single female produced the strings that were fertilized by the same four males. The proportion of eggs fertilized was not equal between males in all three strings, with male 1 siring most offspring (up to 68\% in string 1), through to male 4 siring the least (as low as 2.4\% in string 1).

We examined 4,852 Smallmouth Bass stomachs collected from shoreline habitats during April\textendash September 2013\textendash 2015. Chinook Salmon were the second most commonly consumed fish by all size-classes of Smallmouth Bass ({$\geq$}150 mm TL) throughout the study.

A majority of the loss (61\%) occurred during June, which coincided with the timing of hatchery releases of subyearling fall Chinook Salmon. Compared to an earlier study, mean annual predation loss increased more than 15-fold from 2,670 Chinook Salmon during 1996\textendash 1997 to 41,145 Chinook Salmon during 2013\textendash 2015 (in reaches that could be compared), despite lower contemporary Smallmouth Bass abundances.

Smallmouth Bass are currently significant predators of subyearling Chinook Salmon in Lower Granite Reservoir and could potentially be a large source of unexplained mortality.},

  abstract = {From 2009 to 2011, we identified overwintering reaches and characterized movement behavior and microhabitat suitability for radio-tagged fall migrant spring Chinook salmon Oncorhynchus tshawytscha parr in lower Catherine Creek, northeast Oregon. Primarily, fall migrant parr overwintered in portions of Catherine Creek residing between Union, OR and the mouth of Mill Creek from October through February. To a lesser extent, lower reaches of Catherine Creek and portions of the Grande Ronde River were occupied. Predominantly, movement was directed downstream; however, occasional upstream movement was observed. Median weekly linear range was high during fall migration, while sedentary behavior was prevalent during winter. Brief periods of increased movement were observed during winter and coincided with increased water temperatures. Within the identified overwintering reach, two distinctly different reaches (moderate and low gradient), pertaining to microhabitat availability, were occupied. Generally, free-flowing and surface ice microhabitat use univariate frequency distributions were not significantly different for both reaches. During surface ice conditions, microhabitat use was generally not significantly different between reaches; however, during free-flowing conditions microhabitat use was typically significantly different for all variables measured. Generally, microhabitat use and availability univariate frequency distributions were significantly different for all variables from both reaches (moderate and low gradient) indicating nonrandom habitat use. During free flowing conditions, deep water and slow currents near large woody debris and the bank were most suitable throughout overwintering reaches. Coarse substrates were most suitable in the moderate gradient reach, while fine substrates were most suitable in the low gradient reach. Principal component analyses (PCA) indicated that depth, velocity, substrate, and distance to cover were important microhabitat variable combinations in determining overwintering habitat use in moderate gradient reaches, while depth, velocity, substrate, distance to cover, and distance to bank were most important in low gradient reaches. Radiotelemetry techniques were advantageous toward documenting fall/winter movement and characterizing overwintering microhabitat suitability indices of fall migrant spring Chinook salmon parr. Results from this study suggest appropriate overwintering reaches and types of habitat restoration initiatives needed to successfully implement overwintering habitat improvement projects for spring Chinook salmon parr.},

Our objective was to characterize microhabitat use and suitability for spring Chinook Salmon Oncorhynchus tshawytscha parr during fall and winter. Using radiotelemetry techniques during October\textendash February (2009\textendash 2011), we identified fall and winter microhabitat use by spring Chinook Salmon parr in Catherine Creek, northeastern Oregon. Tagged fish occupied two distinct gradient reaches (moderate and low). Using a mixed-effects logistic regression resource selection function (RSF) model, we found evidence that microhabitat use was similar between free-flowing and surface ice conditions. However, habitat use shifted between seasons; most notably, there was greater use of silt substrate and areas farther from the bank during winter. Between gradients, microhabitat use differed with greater use of large wood (LW) and submerged aquatic vegetation in the low-gradient reach. Using a Bayesian RSF approach, we developed gradient-specific habitat suitability criteria. Throughout the study area, deep depths and slow currents were most suitable, with the exception of the low-gradient reach where moderate depths were optimal. Near-cover coarse and fine substrates were most suitable in the moderateand low-gradient reaches, respectively. Near-bank LW was most suitable throughout the study area. Multivariate principal component analyses (PCA) indicated co-occurring deep depths supporting slow currents near cover were intensively occupied in the moderate-gradient reach. In the low-gradient reach, PCA indicated co-occurring moderate depths, slow currents, and near-bank cover were most frequently occupied. Our study identified suitable and interrelated microhabitat combinations that can guide habitat restoration for fall migrant and overwintering Chinook Salmon parr in Catherine Creek and potentially the Pacific Northwest.},

  abstract = {Overwintering Pacific salmon Oncorhynchus spp. are vulnerable to mortality. Ecosystem degradation exacerbates salmonid vulnerability to mortality; thus, knowledge of winter movement dynamics is essential for guiding holistic management and restoration to safeguard population viability. In northeast Oregon, long-term population performance metrics (e.g., survival) exist for parr of two neighboring Chinook Salmon O. tshawytscha populations (Catherine Creek [CC] and Grande Ronde River [GRR]); however, knowledge of their winter ecology is lacking. Our objective was to spatiotemporally characterize the movements and rearing distributions of naturally produced CC and GRR spring Chinook Salmon parr during fall and winter. Using radiotelemetry techniques (October\textendash February), we identified the movement dynamics of CC (2009\textendash 2012) and GRR (2014\textendash 2016) spring Chinook Salmon fall migrants (i.e., parr overwintering downstream from natal areas). For both populations, median weekly linear range (i.e., movement) was high during fall migration, while sedentary behavior was associated with anchor and surface ice. Fall emigration occurred during declining thermographs, while overwintering parr movement and water temperature peaks were proximate. Fall migrant CC parr predominantly overwintered in the upper Grande Ronde Valley (GRV), while GRR conspecifics primarily reared upstream from the GRV. Extensive portions of CC and the GRR were not included in either population's 99\% kernel density estimate (KDE); however, each population's 99\% KDE extended into the lower GRV. The GRR population's 50\% KDE (i.e., core area) was small and proximate to several North American beaver Castor canadensis impoundments, while the CC population's core area was relatively large and situated in the upper GRV. Overall, CC and GRR fall migrant populations exhibited divergent rearing and movement patterns; however, each population's winter core area was proximate to lentic-like habitats (e.g., beaver ponds). For Chinook Salmon parr, natal-stream-specific overwintering ecology knowledge appears critical to guide winter habitat conservation and restoration, while management for lentic-like habitats may be advisable throughout the Pacific Northwest.},

On the basis of analysis of 2248 natural-origin and 11594 hatchery-origin fish, we estimated that the rate of homing to natal tributaries by natural-origin fish ranged from 0\% to 99\% depending on the tributary. Hatchery-origin fish released in one of the five tributaries homed to that tributary at a far lower rate than the natural-origin fish (71\% compared to 96\%). For hatchery-released fish, stray rates based on parentage analysis were consistent with rates estimated using physical tag recoveries. Stray rates among major spawning tributaries were generally higher than stray rates of tagged fish to areas outside of the Wenatchee River watershed. Within the Wenatchee watershed, rates of straying by natural-origin fish were significantly affected by spawning tributary and by parental origin: progeny of naturally spawning hatchery-produced fish strayed at significantly higher rates than progeny whose parents were themselves of natural origin. Notably, none of the 170 offspring that were products of mating by two naturalorigin fish strayed from their natal tributary. Indirect estimates of gene flow based on FST statistics were correlated with but higher than the estimates from the parentage data. Tributary-specific estimates of effective population size were also correlated with the number of spawners in each tributary.},

  abstract = {Recent progress in methods for detecting adaptive population divergence in situ shows promise for elucidating the conditions under which selection acts to generate intraspecific diversity. Rapid ecological diversification is common in fishes; however, the role of phenotypic plasticity and adaptation to local environments is poorly understood. It is now possible to investigate genetic patterns to make inferences regarding phenotypic traits under selection and possible mechanisms underlying ecotype divergence, particularly where similar novel phenotypes have arisen in multiple independent populations. Here, we employed a bottom-up approach to test for signatures of directional selection associated with divergence of beach- and streamspawning kokanee, the obligate freshwater form of sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka). Beach- and stream-spawners co-exist in many postglacial lakes and exhibit distinct reproductive behaviours, life-history traits and spawning habitat preferences. Replicate ecotype pairs across five lakes in British Columbia, Canada were genotyped at 57 expressed sequence taglinked and anonymous microsatellite loci identified in a previous genome scan. Fifteen loci exhibited signatures of directional selection (high FST outliers), four of which were identified in multiple lakes. However, the lack of parallel genetic patterns across all lakes may be a result of: 1) an inability to detect loci truly under selection; 2) alternative genetic pathways underlying ecotype divergence in this system; and/or 3) phenotypic plasticity playing a formative role in driving kokanee spawning habitat differences. Gene annotations for detected outliers suggest pathogen resistance and energy metabolism as potential mechanisms contributing to the divergence of beach- and stream-spawning kokanee, but further study is required.},

An effort to estimate abundance via a repeated mark-recapture experiment may fail to recapture marked individuals. We devised a method for obtaining lower bounds on abundance in the absence of recaptures for both panmictic and spatially structured populations. The method assumes few enough recaptures were expected to be missed by random chance. The upper Bayesian credible limit on expected recaptures allows probabilistic statements about the minimum number of individuals present in the population. We applied this method to data from a 12-year survey of pallid sturgeon (Scaphirhynchus albus) in the lower and middle Mississippi River (U.S.A.). None of the 241 individuals marked was recaptured in the survey. After accounting for survival and movement, our model-averaged estimate of the total abundance of pallid sturgeon ࣙ3 years old in the study area had a 1\%, 5\%, or 25\% chance of being {$<$}4,600, 7,000, or 15,000, respectively. When we assumed fish were distributed in proportion to survey catch per unit effort, the farthest downstream reach in the survey hosted at least 4.5\textendash 15 fish per river kilometer (rkm), whereas the remainder of the reaches in the lower and middle Mississippi River hosted at least 2.6\textendash 8.5 fish/rkm for all model variations examined. The lower Mississippi River had an average density of pallid sturgeon ࣙ3 years old of at least 3.0\textendash 9.8 fish/rkm. The choice of Bayesian prior was the largest source of uncertainty we considered but did not alter the order of magnitude of lower bounds. Nil-recapture estimates of abundance are highly uncertain and require careful communication but can deliver insights from experiments that might otherwise be considered a failure.},

Despite a strong theoretical foundation, practitioners rarely have sufficient empirical data to evaluate how populations interact. Rather, assumptions about connectivity and source-sink dynamics are often based on incomplete, extrapolated or modeled data, if such interactions are even considered at all. Therefore, it has been difficult to evaluate whether spatially structured species are meeting conservation goals. We evaluated how estimated metapopulation structure responded to estimates of population sizes and dispersal probabilities, and to the set of populations included. We then compared outcomes of alternative management strategies that target conservation of metapopulation processes. We illustrated these concepts for Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) in the Snake River, USA. Our description of spatial structure for this metapopulation was consistent with previous characterizations. We found substantial differences in estimated metapopulation structure when we had incomplete information about all populations and when we used different sources of data (3 empirical, 2 modeled) to estimate dispersal, whereas responses to population size estimates were more consistent. Together, these findings suggest that monitoring efforts should target all populations occasionally and populations that play key roles frequently, and that multiple types of data should be collected when feasible. When empirical data are incomplete or of uneven quality, analyses using estimates produced from an ensemble of available datasets can help conservation planners and managers weigh near-term options. Doing so, we found tradeoffs in connectivity and source dominance in metapopulation-level responses to alternative management strategies that suggest which types of approaches may be inherently less risky.},

  abstract = {Organisms can adapt to local environmental conditions as a plastic response or become adapted through natural selection on genetic variation. The ability to adapt to increased water temperatures will be of paramount importance for many fish species as the climate continues to warm and water resources become limited. Because increased water temperatures will reduce the dissolved oxygen available for fish, we hypothesized that adaptation to low oxygen environments would involve improved respiration through oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS). To test this hypothesis, we subjected individuals from two ecologically divergent populations of inland (redband) rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss gairdneri) with historically different temperature regimes (desert and montane) and their F1 progeny to diel cycles of temperature stress and then examined gene expression data for 80 nuclear- and mitochondrialencoded OXPHOS subunits that participate in respiration. Of the 80 transcripts, 7 showed ! 2-fold difference in expression levels in gill tissue from desert fish under heat stress whereas the montane fish had none and the F1 only had one differentially expressed gene. A structural analysis of the proteins encoded by those genes suggests that the response could coordinate the formation of supercomplexes and oligomers. Supercomplexes may increase the efficiency of respiration because complexes I, III, and IV are brought into close proximity and oligomerization of complex V alters the macrostructure of mitochondria to improve respiration. Significant differences in gene expression patterns in response to heat stress in a common environment indicate that the response was not due to plasticity but had a genetic basis.},

However, multivariate methods used to assess fish community structure and composition are sensitive to differences in the relative scale of indices or measures of abundance produced by different sampling methods. This makes combining data from different sampling gears and methods a serious challenge. We developed a method of combining catch per unit effort data that standardizes catch per unit effort data across gear types, which we call multigear mean standardization (MGMS). We evaluated how well MGMS and other types of standardization reflect underlying community structure through a computer simulation that generated model riverine-fish communities and simulated sampling data for two gears. In these simulations, combining sampling observations from two gears with MGMS produced community structure estimates that were highly correlated with true community structure under a variety of conditions that are common in large rivers. Our simulation results indicate that the use of MGMS to combine data from different sampling gears is an effective data manipulation method for the analysis of fish community structure.},

  abstract = {Determining which factors are most effective for mitigative strategies in conservation management can be difficult for species with complex life cycles. Salmon (Oncorhynchus spp.) migrating through a hydroelectric power system experience conditions that can affect their survival directly within a life stage and indirectly in subsequent life stages through carryover effects. We quantified the association of covariates with survival across life stages of Chinook salmon (O. tshawytscha): juveniles migrating downstream, juveniles in the estuary, subadults in the ocean, and adults migrating upstream. We applied a hierarchical Bayesian mark\textendash recapture model to \textasciitilde 400,000 wild Snake River Chinook salmon (Pacific Northwest, USA). Modeled covariates of survival included migration timing, river temperature, flow, percent of water spilled over dams, snow water equivalent, juvenile fish transportation, juvenile fish length, dam powerhouse passage, sea surface temperature, and the North Pacific Gyre Oscillation. By analyzing these covariates in a unified model, we evaluated their relationships to survival within and across life stages in a common currency. Among direct effects, the negative relationship of sea surface temperature to ocean survival had the largest marginal effect size. Carryover effects also had substantial marginal effect sizes. Ocean survival was associated positively with juvenile length and snow water equivalent and negatively with river temperature. In comparison, direct effects on juvenile and adult survival generally showed smaller marginal effect sizes. Both juvenile and adult survival were negatively associated with river temperature. Juvenile survival increased with fish length, while adult survival was positively related to flow and negatively to percent water spilled at dams. The greatest variability in survival, however, was in the ocean stage. Thus, as the ocean continues to warm and as the human population exerts more pressure on the ecosystem, carryover effects will be increasingly important for recovering salmon and other migratory species.},

In response to repeated calls for more efficient and practical approaches, researchers have developed a geomorphic instream-flow tool (GIFT) that combines a method to simulate reach-averaged hydraulics at flows less than bankfull and depth and velocity frequency distributions to develop streamflow-fish habitat relationships. This approach requires fewer resources to implement than conventional methods, but it has not been widely adopted because it has been subject to minimal testing and validation. This study evaluates the performance of GIFT by comparing its outputs to empirical measurements and conventional model outputs from eight rivers in western North America. The results of this comparison indicate that the root mean square errors for average depth and velocity were 0.078 m and 0.047 m/s, respectively, and the fit of modelled depth and velocity frequency distributions was satisfactory (index of agreement {$>$}0.9) for 11 of 15 surveys for depth and 12 of 15 surveys for velocity. GIFT-derived fish habitat-streamflow relationships peaked at lower flows than benchmark relationships in smaller streams (mean annual discharge [MAD] {$<$} 0.15 m3/s) and are markedly differed from the benchmark in the largest river (MAD of 87 m3/s). GIFT was also paired with a geomorphic regime model to predict the direction of changes in channel morphology and fish habitat following forest harvesting in one watershed. GIFT provides an alternative to conventional modelling approaches for single-thread, gravel-bed rivers with a MAD of around 15 m3/s or less. Application of this technique outside of these bounds, or in other regions should proceed with caution, as these scenarios have not been tested.},

Data were analyzed at all barrier island beaches in North Carolina, USA (515 km) and several variables were statistically significant: distance to hardened structures, beach nourishment, house density, distance to inlets, and beach elevation, slope, and width. Interestingly, variables that were not significant were population density, proximity to the Gulf Stream, and beach aspect. Several statistical techniques were tested and Negative Binomial Distribution produced good regional results while Geographically Weighted Regression models successfully predicted the number of nests with an average of 75\% of the variance explained. Therefore, the combination of traditional and spatial statistics provided insightful predictive modeling results that may be incorporated into management strategies and may have important implications for the designation of critical Loggerhead nesting habitats.},

Using 151 putatively neutral and 29 candidate adaptive SNP loci, we found that climate-related variables (winter precipitation, summer maximum temperature, winter highest 5\% flow events and summer mean flow) best explained neutral and adaptive patterns of genetic differentiation within metapopulations, suggesting that climatic variation likely influences both demography (neutral variation) and local adaptation (adaptive variation). However, we did not observe consistent relationships between climate variables and FST across all metapopulations, underscoring the need for replication when extrapolating results from one scale to another (e.g. basin-wide to the metapopulation scale). Sensitivity analysis (leave-one-population-out) revealed consistent relationships between climate variables and FST within three metapopulations; however, these patterns were not consistent in two metapopulations likely due to small sample sizes (N = 10). These results provide correlative evidence that climatic variation has shaped the genetic structure of steelhead populations and highlight the need for replication and sensitivity analyses in land and riverscape genetics.},

  abstract = {In this investigation, we assessed the effects of rearing conditions on survival and demographics for four yearling summer Chinook Salmon Oncorhynchus tshawytscha hatchery programs from the upper Columbia River basin over four release years. Juveniles from each hatchery program were initially reared at Eastbank Hatchery near Wenatchee, Washington (which uses groundwater for fish rearing), and experienced similar rearing temperatures until their first autumn in culture. Fish from two of the programs were subsequently transferred to surface water acclimation sites, where they were reared until release the following spring (surface water winter rearing). Fish from the other two programs were overwintered at the Eastbank Hatchery and then transferred to their acclimation and release sites one to two months prior to spring release (groundwater winter rearing). These two rearing strategies resulted in contrasting temperature profiles experienced by the fish, which in turn affected winter growth, age at maturation, and smolt-to-adult survival (SAS). Overall, the two release groups that were overwintered on colder surface water experienced reduced winter growth, reduced minijack rate, and smaller size at release, but achieved a two- to threefold higher SAS compared to the two release groups overwintered on warmer groundwater at Eastbank Hatchery. In addition, based on migration data compiled from fish tagged with passive integrated transponder tags, smaller juveniles tended to mature at older age-classes than larger smolts. We conclude that rearing of yearling hatchery summer Chinook Salmon under more natural thermal regimes (surface water) may result in the return of larger, older adults that have a higher survival rate compared with fish reared under constant or less natural thermal regimes (ground water). These results highlight the importance of the hatchery-rearing environment in shaping the survival and life history of summer Chinook Salmon juveniles released into the Columbia River basin.},

Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) are a broadly distributed Pacific salmon species, occupying a diversity of habitats throughout the northeastern Pacific with pronounced variation in environmental and climate features but little is understood regarding local adaptation in this species. We used a multivariate method, redundancy analysis (RDA), to identify polygenic correlations between 19 703 SNP loci and a suite of environmental variables in 46 collections of Chinook salmon (1956 total individuals) distributed throughout much of its North American range. Models in RDA were conducted on both rangewide and regional scales by hierarchical partitioning of the populations into three distinct genetic lineages. Our results indicate that between 5.8 and 21.8\% of genomic variation can be accounted for by environmental features, and 566 putatively adaptive loci were identified as targets of environmental adaptation. The most influential drivers of adaptive divergence included precipitation in the driest quarter of the year (Rangewide and North Coastal Lineage, ANOVA P = 0.002 and 0.01, respectively), precipitation in the wettest quarter of the year (Interior Columbia River Stream-Type Lineage, ANOVA P = 0.03), variation in mean diurnal range in temperature (South Coastal Lineage, ANOVA P = 0.005), and migration distance (Rangewide, ANOVA P = 0.001). Our results indicate that environmental features are strong drivers of adaptive genomic divergence in this species, and provide a foundation to investigate how Chinook salmon might respond to global environmental change.},

Resorption can affect the accuracy of life history interpretations based on scale patterns, depending on the amount of material resorbed. For example, resorption can affect the distinctiveness and characteristics of spawn checks. Spawn checks have been reported in iteroparous salmonids, but no published experimental studies have established the precise relationship between reproduction and scale features. Our objectives were (1) to quantify scale resorption, and (2) to identify contributing factors to the observed resorption in migrating and spawning Snake River steelhead. Prespawn and postspawn scale samples from 72 fish were paired for analysis. We found considerable individual variability in the amount of material resorbed between prespawn and postspawn samples (mean, 26\%; SD, 13.7\%). Most resorption occurred during the winter as gonads matured and secondary sex characteristics were formed. In over half of the postspawn samples, resorption was sufficient to obscure or eliminate an annulus. In a few cases, resorption was minor enough that the eventual spawn check may be indistinct or absent. We recommend that ancillary marks be investigated as a means to help identify weak spawn checks and an index of resorption developed to determine if resorption was sufficient to cause loss of an annulus.},

Yet unexplained findings of within-region population genetic heterogeneity coupled with the morphological and behavioural diversity described for the species suggest that adaptive genetic variation underlying fitness traits may be responsible. We employed restriction site\textendash associated DNA sequencing to genotype 4439 quality filtered single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) loci for 518 individuals collected across a broad geographical area including British Columbia, Washington, Oregon and California. A subset of putatively neutral markers (N = 4068) identified a significant amount of variation among three broad populations: northern British Columbia, Columbia River/southern coast and `dwarf' adults (FCT = 0.02, P {$\ll$} 0.001). Additionally, 162 SNPs were identified as adaptive through outlier tests, and inclusion of these markers revealed a signal of adaptive variation related to geography and life history. The majority of the 162 adaptive SNPs were not independent and formed four groups of linked loci. Analyses with MATSAM software found that 42 of these outlier SNPs were significantly associated with geography, run timing and dwarf life history, and 27 of these 42 SNPs aligned with known genes or highly conserved genomic regions using the genome browser available for sea lamprey. This study provides both neutral and adaptive context for observed genetic divergence among collections and thus reconciles previous findings of population genetic heterogeneity within a species that displays extensive gene flow.},

This ability would benefit conservation of one such declining species, anadromous Pacific lamprey (Entosphenus tridentatus). Nonphilopatric migration of adult Pacific lamprey has homogenized population-level neutral variation but has maintained adaptive variation that differentiates groups based on geography, run-timing and adult body form. To investigate causes for this adaptive divergence, we examined 647 adult lamprey sampled at a fixed location on the Columbia River and radiotracked during their subsequent upstream migration. We tested whether genetic variation [94 neutral and adaptive single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) previously identified from a genomewide association study] was associated with phenotypes of migration distance, migration timing, or morphology. Three adaptive markers were strongly associated with morphology, and one marker also correlated with upstream migration distance and timing. Genes physically linked with these markers plausibly influence differences in body size, which is also consistently associated with migration distance in Pacific lamprey. Pacific lamprey conservation implications include the potential to predict an individual's upstream destination based on its genotype. More broadly, the results suggest a genetic basis for intrapopulation variation in migration distance in migratory species.},

Nine of these SNPs are FST outliers, and five of these outliers are localized within genes and significantly associated with geography, run-timing and dwarf life history. Two of the 96 SNPs were diagnostic for two other lamprey species that were morphologically indistinguishable at early larval stages and were sympatric in the Pacific Northwest. The majority (85) of SNPs in the panel were highly informative for parentage analysis, that is, putatively neutral with high minor allele frequency across the species' range. Results from three case studies are presented to demonstrate the broad utility of this panel of SNP markers in this species. As Pacific lamprey populations are undergoing rapid decline, these SNPs provide an important resource to address critical uncertainties associated with the conservation and recovery of this imperiled species.},

Here, we used parentage-based tagging (PBT) together with mixed stock analyses (MSA) to estimate stock-specific abundance and migration-timing in anadromous adult steelhead (Oncorhynchus mykiss) sampled at Bonneville Dam in the lower Columbia River. Results indicate that natural-origin steelhead was represented by 11 of 13 possible stocks found throughout the Columbia-Snake river basins, while hatchery-origin steelhead was primarily composed of five stocks from the Snake River drainage. Further, migration-timing differentiated stocks and allowed categorization of early, intermediate, and late migrating stocks. Analyses of age and length data for these stocks also showed that late-arriving fish were larger due to older age and originated primarily from the Clearwater River, South Fork Salmon River, and Dworshak Hatchery, all from the Snake River drainage. Sex ratios tended to be skewed towards females and ranged from 51.5 to 68.9\% for hatchery stocks and 60.5\textendash 71.8\% for natural-origin stocks. This suggests that anadromous migration is favored by females while males are more likely to residualize in freshwater. Overall, this study demonstrates how the use of PBT in MSA can reveal important stock-specific differences in migration-timing and relative abundance and provides critical information for management of mixed stock fisheries.},

Endangered Species Act of 1973, Snake River spring-summer Chinook Salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) have been the subject of numerous population viability analyses (PVAs). In all of the previous PVAs that we are aware of, management actions to improve the species' status have focused on increasing survival rates of juveniles and adults. These PVAs did not explicitly treat carry capacity; instead, they assumed that survival rate improvements increased intrinsic productivity, and implicitly assumed that this would also increase carrying capacity. In a novel alternative approach, we instead examined how carrying capacity itself was related to extinction risk. We estimated three alternative multi-population PVAs using maximum likelihood estimation and chose the model with the best fit to the spawner-recruit data from 26 populations in the Snake River Spring/Summer Chinook Salmon evolutionarily significant unit. We then estimated carrying capacity and 24-year extinction probability for each of these populations using alternative quasiextinction thresholds. We found that carrying capacities estimates were low in several of the populations and that extinction probability increases sharply with decreasing carrying capacity. A sensitivity analysis with fixed carrying capacities and increasing intrinsic productivity illustrated that unless actions increase carrying capacity, little change in extinction risk can occur.},

The Klamath River basin (California\textendash Oregon) provides a particularly interesting backdrop for the study of life history diversity in O. mykiss, in part because the river is slated for a historic and potentially influential dam removal and habitat recolonization project. We used scale and otolith strontium isotope (87Sr/86Sr) analyses to characterize life history diversity in wild O. mykiss from the lower Klamath River basin. We also determined maternal origin (anadromous or nonanadromous) and migratory history (anadromous or nonanadromous) of O. mykiss and compared length and fecundity at age between anadromous (steelhead) and nonanadromous (Rainbow Trout) phenotypes of O. mykiss. We identified a total of 38 life history categories at maturity, which differed in duration of freshwater and ocean rearing, age at maturation, and incidence of repeat spawning. Approximately 10\% of adult fish sampled were nonanadromous. Rainbow Trout generally grew faster in freshwater than juvenile steelhead; however, ocean growth afforded adult steelhead greater length and fecundity than adult Rainbow Trout. Although 75\% of individuals followed the migratory path of their mother, steelhead produced nonanadromous progeny and Rainbow Trout produced anadromous progeny. Overall, we observed a highly diverse array of life histories among Klamath River O. mykiss. While this diversity should increase population resilience, recent declines in the abundance of Klamath River steelhead suggest that life history diversity alone is not sufficient to stabilize a population. Our finding that steelhead and Rainbow Trout give rise to progeny of the alternate form (1) suggests that dam removal might lead to a facultatively anadromous O. mykiss population in the upper basin and (2) raises the question of whether both forms of O. mykiss in the Klamath River should be managed under the same strategy.},

  abstract = {Sharks vary greatly in morphology, physiology, and ecology. Differences in whole body shape, swimming style, and physiological parameters have previously been linked to varied habitat uses. Pectoral fin morphology has been used to taxonomically classify species and hypotheses on the functional differences in shape are noted throughout the literature; however, there are limited comparative datasets that quantify external and skeletal morphology. Further, fins were previously categorized into two discrete groups based on the amount of skeletal support present: (a) aplesodic, where less than half of the fin is supported and (b) plesodic where greater than half of the fin is supported. These discrete classifications have been used to phylogenetically place species, though the methodology of classification is infrequently described. In this study, we sampled fins from 18 species, 6 families, and 3 orders, which were also grouped into five ecomorphotype classifications. We examined the external morphology, extent of skeletal support, and cross-sectional shape of individual cartilaginous elements. Using phylogenetic comparative methods, we show that fin shape does not differ significantly between ecomorphotypes, suggesting there may be some mechanical constraint. However, we find that the internal anatomy of the fin does vary significantly between ecomorphotypes, especially the extent and distribution of calcification of skeletal support, suggesting that the superficial similarity of fin shapes across ecomorphotypes may belie differences in function. Finally, we find that a number of morphological variables such as number of radials, radial calcification and shape, and fin taper all correlate with the extent of skeletal support. Within these morphospaces, we also describe that some orders/families tend to occupy certain areas with limited overlap. While we demonstrate that there is some mechanical constraint limiting external variations in shark pectoral fin morphology, there are compounding differences in skeletal anatomy that occur within ecomorphotypes which we propose may affect function.},

We estimated there were 3,905 adfluvial individuals in Mann Creek Reservoir in October 2008 based on a mark\textendash recapture population estimate. The adfluvial population sex ratio of 2.78 females per male captured at a weir, peak spawn timing near the peak of the hydrograph (late April), age at spawning (4\textendash 6 years), and growth patterns (slow growth in the stream followed by rapid growth in the reservoir) were all characteristic of an anadromous population. Resident fish abundance was not estimated, but the fish were characterized by relatively slow growth, earlier sexual maturity, and a reverse sex ratio (0.23 females per male) compared with the adfluvial fish. The two life histories (resident and adfluvial) and their differential use by the sexes are consistent with life history theory, which suggests female salmonids maximize fitness by increasing body size and fecundity while males attempt to maximize survival at the expense of growth. The migratory fish in this drainage that could have historically exercised an anadromous life history appear to be exercising the next-best option, an adfluvial life history, which has relatively similar costs and benefits to the anadromous form as distinct from the stream-resident form. Future studies should evaluate other similar native populations isolated in reservoir systems because these populations could play a role in recovery of endangered steelhead (anadromous Rainbow Trout) populations in the western USA.},

  abstract = {Thermal regimes in rivers and streams are fundamentally important to aquatic ecosystems and are expected to change in response to climate forcing as the Earth's temperature warms. Description and attribution of stream temperature changes are key to understanding how these ecosystems may be affected by climate change, but difficult given the rarity of long-term monitoring data. We assembled 18 temperature time-series from sites on regulated and unregulated streams in the northwest U.S. to describe historical trends from 1980\textendash 2009 and assess thermal consistency between these stream categories. Statistically significant temperature trends were detected across seven sites on unregulated streams during all seasons of the year, with a cooling trend apparent during the spring and warming trends during the summer, fall, and winter. The amount of warming more than compensated for spring cooling to cause a net temperature increase, and rates of warming were highest during the summer (raw trend = 0.17\textdegree C/decade; reconstructed trend = 0.22\textdegree C/decade). Air temperature was the dominant factor explaining long-term stream temperature trends (82\textendash 94\% of trends) and inter-annual variability (48\textendash 86\% of variability), except during the summer when discharge accounted for approximately half (52\%) of the inter-annual variation in stream temperatures. Seasonal temperature trends at eleven sites on regulated streams were qualitatively similar to those at unregulated sites if two sites managed to reduce summer and fall temperatures were excluded from the analysis. However, these trends were never statistically significant due to greater variation among sites that resulted from local water management policies and effects of upstream reservoirs. Despite serious deficiencies in the stream temperature monitoring record, our results suggest many streams in the northwest U.S. are exhibiting a regionally coherent response to climate forcing. More extensive monitoring efforts are needed as are techniques for short-term sensitivity analysis and reconstructing historical temperature trends so that spatial and temporal patterns of warming can be better understood. Continuation of warming trends this century will increasingly stress important regional salmon and trout resources and hamper efforts to recover these species, so comprehensive vulnerability assessments are needed to provide strategic frameworks for prioritizing conservation efforts.},

  abstract = {The imminent demise of montane species is a recurrent theme in the climate change literature, particularly for aquatic species that are constrained to networks and elevational rather than latitudinal retreat as temperatures increase. Predictions of widespread species losses, however, have yet to be fulfilled despite decades of climate change, suggesting that trends are much weaker than anticipated and may be too subtle for detection given the widespread use of sparse water temperature datasets or imprecise surrogates like elevation and air temperature. Through application of large water-temperature databases evaluated for sensitivity to historical air-temperature variability and computationally interpolated to provide high-resolution thermal habitat information for a 222,000-km network, we estimate a less dire thermal plight for cold-water species within mountains of the northwestern United States. Stream warming rates and climate velocities were both relatively low for 1968\textendash 2011 (average warming rate = 0.101 \textdegree C/decade; median velocity = 1.07 km/decade) when air temperatures warmed at 0.21 \textdegree C/decade. Many cold-water vertebrate species occurred in a subset of the network characterized by low climate velocities, and three native species of conservation concern occurred in extremely cold, slow velocity environments (0.33\textendash 0.48 km/decade). Examination of aggressive warming scenarios indicated that although network climate velocities could increase, they remain low in headwaters because of strong local temperature gradients associated with topographic controls. Better information about changing hydrology and disturbance regimes is needed to complement these results, but rather than being climatic cul-de-sacs, many mountain streams appear poised to be redoubts for cold-water biodiversity this century.},

  abstract = {Temperature profoundly affects ecology, a fact ever more evident as the ability to measure thermal environments increases and global changes alter these environments. The spatial structure of thermalscapes is especially relevant to the distribution and abundance of ectothermic organisms, but the ability to describe biothermal relationships at extents and grains relevant to conservation planning has been limited by small or sparse data sets. Here, we combine a large occurrence database of {$>$}23{$\mkern1mu$}000 aquatic species surveys with stream microclimate scenarios supported by an equally large temperature database for a 149{$\mkern1mu$}000-\-km mountain stream network to describe thermal relationships for 14 fish and amphibian species. Species occurrence probabilities peaked across a wide range of temperatures (7.0\textendash 18.8\textdegree C) but distinct warm-\-or cold-e\- dge distribution boundaries were apparent for all species and represented environments where populations may be most sensitive to thermal changes. Warm-e\- dge boundary temperatures for a native species of conservation concern were used with geospatial data sets and a habitat occupancy model to highlight subsets of the network where conservation measures could benefit local populations by maintaining cool temperatures. Linking that strategic approach to local estimates of habitat impairment remains a key challenge but is also an \-opportunity to build relationships and develop synergies between the research, management, and regulatory communities. As with any data mining or species distribution modeling exercise, care is required in analysis and interpretation of results, but the use of large biological data sets with accurate microclimate scenarios can provide valuable information about the thermal ecology of many ectotherms and a spatially explicit way of guiding conservation investments.},

  abstract = {Thermal regimes are fundamental determinants of aquatic ecosystems, which makes description and prediction of temperatures critical during a period of rapid global change. The advent of inexpensive temperature sensors dramatically increased monitoring in recent decades, and although most monitoring is done by individuals for agency-specific purposes, collectively these efforts constitute a massive distributed sensing array that generates an untapped wealth of data. Using the framework provided by the National Hydrography Dataset, we organized temperature records from dozens of agencies in the western U.S. to create the NorWeST database that hosts {$>$}220,000,000 temperature recordings from {$>$}22,700 stream and river sites. Spatial-stream-network models were fit to a subset of those data that described mean August water temperatures (AugTw) during 63,641 monitoring site-years to develop accurate temperature models (r2 5 0.91; RMSPE 5 1.108C; MAPE 5 0.728C), assess covariate effects, and make predictions at 1 km intervals to create summer climate scenarios. AugTw averaged 14.28C (SD 5 4.08C) during the baseline period of 1993\textendash 2011 in 343,000 km of western perennial streams but trend reconstructions also indicated warming had occurred at the rate of 0.178C/decade (SD 5 0.0678C/decade) during the 40 year period of 1976\textendash 2015. Future scenarios suggest continued warming, although variation will occur within and among river networks due to differences in local climate forcing and stream responsiveness. NorWeST scenarios and data are available online in user-friendly digital formats and are widely used to coordinate monitoring efforts among agencies, for new research, and for conservation planning.},

The model assumed that fish passage during a breach of the weir was typical of passage during normal operations. Counts of fish passing the weir were missing for some days during the runs, or only partial counts for a given 24-hour period were available. The HBM approach provided more defensible estimates of missing data and total escapement than ad hoc or year-by-year model estimates, because estimates of passage for a given year were informed not only by counts for the current year, but also by counts for all previous years. The results of the HBM yielded less variable estimates of escapement than did ad hoc or year-by-year model estimates. The HBM represents a standardized approach to estimate missing counts and total escapement and eliminates the need for ad hoc estimates of missing counts. The model also provides managers with a measure of uncertainty around estimates of escapement and around estimates of hyper-parameters to define run curves in subsequent years with incomplete fish counts.},

  abstract = {Steelhead Oncorhynchus mykiss are known for their life history diversity, displaying a range of freshwater residence ages, maturation ages, and spawning intervals. Female maturation is thought to be condition dependent at critical periods, during which individuals falling below energetic thresholds remain reproductively inactive for the subsequent annual cycle. After their initial, or maiden, spawning, females may enter into another maturation cycle and spawn after 1 year (consecutive spawners) or 2 years (skip spawners). The purpose of this study was to quantify reproductive performance in maiden, consecutive, and skip spawning female steelhead, which differ in their energy availability schedules during ovarian development, in order to quantify the benefits that can be expected from kelt reconditioning programs. Hatchery origin female steelhead returning to Dworshak National Fish Hatchery for their maiden spawning (Clearwater River, Idaho, 2013\textendash 2016) were manually spawned, placed in tanks, and reconditioned. Size (somatic mass, FL) and reproductive performance (total, individual, and dry egg mass, fecundity, and fertilization success) were measured, and spawn date fidelity was determined. Repeat spawners had greater mass, length, and mass at length than did maiden spawners. In absolute terms, skip spawners had greater total, individual, and dry egg mass than maiden and consecutive spawners, and both consecutive and skip spawners had greater fecundity than did maiden spawners. When standardized for size, skip spawners had greater total, individual, and dry egg mass than maiden and consecutive spawners; size-standardized consecutive spawners had lower individual egg mass than maiden spawners but higher fecundity. Our results suggest that egg size and reproductive investment are determined early in oogenesis based on an assessment of energy reserves, and do not increase when excess energy is available during the vitellogenic period of oogenesis. Instead, excess energy during the vitellogenic period is allocated to somatic growth. Increases in fecundity and egg size suggest that reconditioned kelts released to spawn naturally will be more productive than maiden spawners.},

Surveys also showed that out of state recreationalists mispronounced `Chequamegon' in 75\% of cases. Wisconsin residents mispronounced the word in 62\% of cases, mainly due to alcohol induced slurring.},

  abstract = {Understanding how stream temperature responds to restoration of riparian vegetation and channel morphology in context of future climate change is critical for prioritizing restoration actions and recovering imperiled salmon populations. We used a deterministic water temperature model to investigate potential thermal benefits of riparian reforestation and channel narrowing to Chinook Salmon populations in the Upper Grande Ronde River and Catherine Creek basins in Northeast Oregon, USA. A legacy of intensive land use practices in these basins has significantly reduced streamside vegetation and increased channel width across most of the stream network, resulting in water temperatures that far exceed the optimal range for salmon growth and survival. By combining restoration scenarios with climate change projections, we were able to evaluate whether future climate impacts could be offset by restoration actions. A combination of riparian restoration and channel narrowing was predicted to reduce peak summer water temperatures by 6.5  C on average in the Upper Grande Ronde River and 3.0  C in Catherine Creek in the absence of other perturbations. These results translated to increases in Chinook Salmon parr abundance of 590\% and 67\% respectively. Although projected climate change impacts on water temperature for the 2080s time period were substantial (i.e., median increase of 2.7  C in the Upper Grande Ronde and 1.5  C in Catherine Creek), we predicted that basin-wide restoration of riparian vegetation and channel width could offset these impacts, reducing peak summer water temperatures by about 3.5  C in the Upper Grande Ronde and 1.8  C in Catherine Creek. These results underscore the potential for riparian and stream channel restoration to mitigate climate change impacts to threatened salmon populations in the Pacific Northwest.},

Mechanized pressure appeared to be the most efficient method of stomach flushing for most large fishes. The use of syringes allowed stomach flushing to be performed on most young and small fishes.

  abstract = {Stream monitoring data provides insights into the biological, chemical and physical status of running waters. Additionally, it can be used to identify drivers of chemical or ecological water quality, to inform related management actions, and to forecast future conditions under land use and global change scenarios. Measurements from sites along the same stream may not be statistically independent, and the R package SSN provides a way to describe spatial autocorrelation when modelling relationships between measured variables and potential drivers. However, SSN requires the user to provide the stream network and sampling locations in a certain format. Likewise, other applications require catchment delineation and intersection of different spatial data. We developed the R package openSTARS that provides the functionality to derive stream networks from a digital elevation model, delineate stream catchments and intersect them with land use or other GIS data as potential predictors. Additionally, locations for model predictions can be generated automatically along the stream network. We present an example workflow of all data preparation steps. In a case study using data from water monitoring sites in Southern Germany, the resulting stream network and derived site characteristics matched those constructed using STARS, an ArcGIS custom toolbox. An advantage of openSTARS is that it relies on free and open-source GRASS GIS and R functions, unlike the original STARS toolbox which depends on proprietary ArcGIS. openSTARS also comes without a graphical user interface, to enhance reproducibility and reusability of the workflow, thereby harmonizing and simplifying the data preprocessing prior to statistical modelling. Overall, openSTARS facilitates the use of spatial regression and other applications on stream networks and contributes to reproducible science with applications in hydrology, environmental sciences and ecology.},

The late run was predominated by steelhead from Idaho's Clearwater and Salmon rivers that must pass eight large hydroelectric dams during both prespawn and postspawn migrations. In 2 years (2013 and 2014), prespawn survival to Snake River tributaries ({$>$}500 km) was 0.48\textendash 0.67 for the most abundant populations and was higher for females and 1-sea fish (i.e., fish that spend one winter at sea). Annual survival from Snake River tributary entry to postspawn kelt status was 0.14\textendash 0.17, with higher survival for females and those without hatchery fin clips. Kelt outmigration survival was 0.31\textendash 0.39 past four Snake River dams and 0.13\textendash 0.20 past all eight dams and was highest for smaller kelts. Full-cycle adult freshwater survival (sea-to-sea) including 16 dam passage events was 0.01\textendash 0.02. Younger steelhead and those without fin clips survived at the highest rates. This study uniquely partitioned mortality across prespawn, reproductive, and kelt life history stages and informs management strategies for this conservation-priority metapopulation.},

  abstract = {Oncorhynchus mykiss form partially migratory populations with anadromous fish that undergo marine migrations and residents that complete their life cycle in fresh water. Many populations' anadromous components are threatened or endangered, prompting interest in understanding ecological and evolutionary processes underlying anadromy and residency. In this paper, we synthesize information to better understand genetic and environmental influences on O. mykiss life histories, identify critical knowledge gaps, and suggest next steps. Anadromy and residency appear to reflect interactions among genetics, individual condition, and environmental influences. First, an increasing body of literature suggests that anadromous and resident individuals differ in the expression of genes related to growth, smoltification, and metabolism. Second, the literature supports the conditional strategy theory, where individuals adopt a life history pattern based on their conditional status relative to genetic thresholds along with ultimate effects of size and age at maturation and iteroparity. However, except for a generally positive association between residency and high lipid content plus a large attainable size in fresh water, the effects of body size and growth are inconsistent. Thus, individuals can exhibit plasticity in variable environments. Finally, patterns in anadromy and residency among and within populations suggested a wide range of possible environmental influences at different life stages, from freshwater temperature to marine survival. Although we document a number of interesting correlations, direct tests of mechanisms are scarce and little data exist on the extent of residency and anadromy. Consequently, we identified as many data gaps as conclusions, leaving ample room for future research.},

Declines in smolt survival rates were seen for three of the four groupings. Puget Sound and Keogh River populations have experienced low rates since the early 1990s. Correlations between population pairs' time series and distance apart illustrated that smolt survival rates were more positively correlated for proximate populations, suggesting that important processes, including those related to ocean survival, occur early in the marine life of steelhead.},

  abstract = {Nonnative Brook Trout Salvelinus fontinalis were introduced throughout western North America in the early 1900s, resulting in widespread self-sustaining nonnative populations that are difficult to eradicate and often threaten native salmonid populations. A novel approach to eradicating undesirable Brook Trout populations is using YY male (MYY) Brook Trout (created in the hatchery by feminizing XY males and crossing them with normal XY males). If MYY Brook Trout survive after stocking, and reproduce successfully with wild females, in theory this would eventually drive the sex ratio of the wild population to 100\% males, at which point the population would become functionally eliminated. We stocked MYY Brook Trout in four streams in central Idaho in June 2014; in two of these streams, the wild Brook Trout population was suppressed via electrofishing prior to stocking to determine if diminished competition with wild fish would increase survival of MYY fish. We conducted electrofishing surveys in October 2014 to estimate (1) abundance of wild and MYY Brook Trout, (2) apparent mortality for MYY fish, and (3) apparent emigration of MYY fish from the stocking reaches. We tissue sampled wild Brook Trout fry in 2014 to genotype the wild population and estimate wild sex ratios in all study streams. We tissue sampled Brook Trout fry again in 2015 and conducted genetic assignment testing to identify successful reproduction of the stocked MYY fish. Apparent survival of MYY Brook Trout averaged 11\% (range 7-21\%), and may have been improved in one stream by removing wild fish. We estimated that MYY fish comprised 2.7\% (range 2.1-3.2\%) of all adult spawning Brook Trout in the fall of 2014. Genetic assignment tests in 2015 identified successful reproduction of MYY fish in all streams in which they were stocked, with an average of 3.7\% (range 2.1-5.0\%) of fry being the progeny of MYY fish. These results confirm that MYY Brook Trout stocked in streams can survive and spawn successfully with wild fish, suggesting that MYY Brook Trout may indeed be a useful tool to eradicate undesirable nonnative Brook Trout populations.},

Here, we identified 10 944 single-nucleotide polymorphisms using restriction-site-associated DNA (RAD) sequencing to explore population structure, demography, and adaptive divergence in five populations of Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) from western Alaska. Patterns of population structure were similar to those of past studies, but our ability to assign individuals back to their region of origin was greatly improved ({$>$}90\% accuracy for all populations). We also calculated effective size with and without removing physically linked loci identified from a linkage map, a novel method for nonmodel organisms. Estimates of effective size were generally above 1000 and were biased downward when physically linked loci were not removed. Outlier tests based on genetic differentiation identified 733 loci and three genomic regions under putative selection. These markers and genomic regions are excellent candidates for future research and can be used to create high-resolution panels for genetic monitoring and population assignment. This work demonstrates the utility of genomic data to inform conservation in highly exploited species with shallow population structure.},

Here, we used genotyping-by-sequencing and a combination of previously published and newly generated data to construct sex-specific linkage maps for sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka). We then used the denser female linkage map to conduct quantitative trait locus (QTL) analysis for 4 phenotypic traits in 3 families.The female linkage map consisted of 6322 loci distributed across 29 linkage groups and was 4082 cM long, and the male map contained 2179 loci found on 28 linkage groups and was 2291 cM long. We found 26 QTL: 6 for thermotolerance, 5 for length, 9 for weight, and 6 for condition factor. QTL were distributed nonrandomly across the genome and were often found in hotspots containing multiple QTL for a variety of phenotypic traits.These hotspots may represent adaptively important regions and are excellent candidates for future research. Comparing our results with studies in other salmonids revealed several regions with overlapping QTL for the same phenotypic trait, indicating these regions may be adaptively important across multiple species. Altogether, our study demonstrates the utility of genomic data for investigating the genetic basis of important phenotypic traits. Additionally, the linkage map created here will enable future research on the genetic basis of phenotypic traits in salmon.},

The most promising areas of development are in the assessment of temporal changes in genetic composition for the estimation of contemporary Ne and the application of coalescent theory for estimation of historical Ne. Application of most estimators still requires making some questionable assumptions about wildlife populations.

For instance, examination of trade-offs between reproduction and survival usually rely on individually marked animals, for which the exact time of death is most often unknown, because marked individuals cannot be followed closely through time. Thus, the quantitative analysis of survival studies and experiments must be based on capturerecapture (or resighting) models which consider, besides the parameters of primary interest, recapture or resighting rates that are nuisance parameters. Capture-recapture models oriented to estimation of survival rates are the result of a recent change in emphasis from earlier approaches in which population size was the most important parameter, survival rates having been first introduced as nuisance parameters. This emphasis on survival rates in capture-recapture models developed rapidly in the 1980s and used as a basic structure the Cormack-Jolly-Seber survival model applied to an homogeneous group of animals, with various kinds of constraints on the model parameters. These approaches are conditional on first captures; hence they do not attempt to model the initial capture of unmarked animals as functions of population abundance in addition to survival and capture probabilities.},

These findings support continued habitat restoration and protection of San Francisco Bay Area O. mykiss populations and demonstrate that ecological conditions in novel habitats above barriers to anadromy influence life history evolution. We highlight the importance of considering the adaptive landscape in conservation and restoration programs for species living in highly modified habitats, particularly with respect to key life-history traits.},

We analysed 607 individuals from 18 spawning locations in the northeast Atlantic, including two temperature clines (5\textendash 12 \textdegree C) and two salinity clines (5\textendash 35\&). By combining genome scan and landscape genetic analyses, four genetically distinct groups of herring were identified: Baltic Sea, Baltic\textendash North Sea transition area, North Sea {$\fracslash$} British Isles and North Atlantic; notably, samples exhibited divergent clustering patterns for neutral and selected loci. We found statistically strong evidence for divergent selection at 16 outlier loci on a global scale, and significant correlations with temperature and salinity at nine loci. On regional scales, we identified two outlier loci with parallel patterns across temperature clines and five loci associated with temperature in the North Sea {$\fracslash$} North Atlantic. Likewise, we found seven replicated outliers, of which five were significantly associated with low salinity across both salinity clines. Our results reveal a complex pattern of varying spatial genetic variation among outlier loci, likely reflecting adaptations to local environments. In addition to disclosing the fine scale of local adaptation in a highly vagile species, our data emphasize the need to preserve functionally important biodiversity.},

The objectives of this study were to develop a SNP panel for parentage assignment in rainbow trout and to evaluate the accuracy of parentage assignment using fish with known pedigrees. Two groups of SNPs were targeted: 1) genome SNPs distributed across all 29 chromosomes; and 2) previously identified trait-associated SNPs. Among the 128 SNPs selected for assay development, 102 (79.7\%) working assays were developed. A panel of 95 SNP assays including 68 genome SNPs and 27 trait-associated SNPs was used to genotype 499 fish with known pedigrees from Troutlodge, Inc. and from the USDA/ARS National Center for Cool and Cold Water Aquaculture. Parentage assignments matched perfectly with the known pedigrees when all 95 SNPs were used. Near perfect parentage assignment was obtained with the 68 genome SNPs, and the accuracy of parentage assignment was over 98\% with a subset of 48 genome SNPs. Therefore, these SNP assays are robust and enable accurate parentage analysis in populations that are typically used in rainbow trout breeding programs.},

  abstract = {Identifying the stream of origin of spawning-phase sea lamprey (Petromyzon marinus) is crucial to improve the control of this nuisance species in the Laurentian Great Lakes and Lake Champlain. Recently, Howe et al. (2013) found a poor accuracy in the natal origin assignment of 33 spawning adults of known-origin from the Lake Champlain watershed using the statoliths from larvae captured in their natal streams to develop discriminant functions. Herein, we revisited the natal origin assignment of the same sample of adults, this time using the statoliths from newly-metamorphosed sea lampreys (transformers) captured in their natal stream. Using laser-ablation inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry, 216 transformers originating from 11 Lake Champlain tributaries were successfully discriminated with a classification accuracy of 78\% (range: 40-100\%), with rubidium (Rb) and strontium (Sr) as the most discriminating elements. However, the assignment to the correct (known) natal origin for adults was poor. While the majority of adults were known to originate from Lewis and Malletts creeks, our maximum likelihood procedure did not assign any adults to these streams. Such result might be explained by temporal and analytical variability of elemental signatures and by a mismatch in Rb concentrations between transformers and adults probably due to physiological effects. We do not recommend the use of statolith microchemistry to classify adults to a natal tributary when Rb is considered as a discriminating element until we can understand and predict the shift in Rb between metamorphosis and the spawning adult life stage.},

Three stockings of OTC-marked fry from an egg source on the Pike River were conducted at densities of 274 to 358 fry/ha to expedite the recovery of the spawning stock in which the adult female biomass had fallen below 0.5 kg/ha for 10 consecutive years. Two additional stockings of OTC-marked fry from an egg source on a Red Lakes tributary were then conducted at 33 and 87 fry/ha to help quantify natural reproduction as the spawning stock recovered. Subsequent inspection of fish from seine and gill-net samples indicated that Pike River fish composed 50\% to 94 \% of the stocked year-classes and that the stocked year-classes were three of the strongest in the past 25 years. The Pike River fish survived, grew, and matured at rates similar to the native fish, contributing to an increase in adult female biomass ranging from 2.5 to 8.0 kg/ha. Natural reproduction also increased from a range of 8\textendash 120 fry/ha to a range of 199\textendash 908 fry/ha, with 49\% to 53\% Pike River ancestry. For the first 2 years after maturation of the first stocked year-class, however, Pike River ancestry was 13\textendash 31 percentage points below what was expected from the relative abundance of Pike River adults in the population. The proportion of Pike River adults present on the tributary spawning runs was also initially below expectations. Both spawning participation and success of Pike River adults increased in successive years, and the stocked fry were judged to have accelerated the recovery of the population to a sustainable and fishable status without the need for additional stocking.},

  abstract = {Diverse marine animals migrate across vast expanses of seemingly featureless ocean before returning as adults to reproduce in the area where they originated. How animals accomplish such feats of natal homing is an enduring mystery. Growing evidence suggests, however, that sea turtles and salmon imprint on the magnetic field of their home area when young and then use this information to return as adults. Both turtles and salmon have the sensory abilities needed to detect the unique `magnetic signature' of a coastal area. Analyses have revealed that, for both groups of animals, subtle changes in the geomagnetic field of the home region are correlated with changes in natal homing behavior. In turtles, a relationship between population genetic structure and the magnetic fields that exist at nesting beaches has also been detected, consistent with the hypothesis that turtles recognize their natal areas on the basis of magnetic cues. Salmon likely use a biphasic navigational strategy in which magnetic cues guide fish through the open sea and into the proximity of the home river where chemical cues allow completion of the spawning migration. Similarly, turtles may also exploit local cues to help pinpoint nesting areas once they have arrived in the vicinity. Throughout most of the natal homing migration, however, magnetic navigation appears to be the primary mode of long-distance guidance in both sea turtles and salmon.},

We used computer simulations to quantify bias and precision of the one-sample LDNe estimator of Nb in agestructured populations using a range of published species life history types, sample sizes, and DNA markers. Nb estimates were biased by \textasciitilde 5\%\textendash 10\% when using SNPs or microsatellites in species ranging from fishes to mosquitoes, frogs, and seaweed. The bias (high or low) was similar for different life history types within a species suggesting that life history variation in populations will not influence Nb estimation. Precision was higher for 100 SNPs (H {$\approx$} 0.30) than for 15 microsatellites (H {$\approx$} 0.70). Confidence intervals (CIs) were occasionally too narrow, and biased high when Nb was small (Nb {$<$} 50); however, the magnitude of bias would unlikely influence management decisions. The CIs (from LDNe) were sufficiently narrow to achieve high statistical power ({$\geq$}0.80) to reject the null hypothesis that Nb = 50 when the true Nb = 30 and when sampling 50 individuals and 200 SNPs. Similarly, CIs were sufficiently narrow to reject Nb = 500 when the true Nb = 400 and when sampling 200 individuals and 5,000 loci. Finally, we present a linear regression method that provides high power to detect a decline in Nb when sampling at least five consecutive cohorts. This study provides guidelines and tools to simulate and estimate Nb for age structured populations (https://github.com/ popgen gui/agestrucnb/), which should help biologists develop sensitive monitoring programmes for early detection of changes in Nb and population declines.},

Through 2008, PIT tags have been implanted into 22 million parr and smolts originating from hatcheries and natal streams throughout the Basin. During their downstream migration, more than 8.5 million PIT-tagged fish have been passively detected as they are bypassed at one or more large hydroelectric dams in the main-stem Columbia and Snake rivers. As PIT tag technology has improved, larger detection systems have been installed in the adult fish passage facilities at many of these dams and elsewhere throughout the Basin. Tagged salmon and steelhead are commonly detected at multiple locations in the Columbia and Snake rivers and their tributaries during their downstream and subsequent upstream migrations. In addition to these passive detection events, more than 620,000 tagged fish have been physically recaptured, providing an opportunity to observe and record changes to the morphology and physiology of an individual tagged fish before re-releasing it. Almost 850,000 PIT tags have been recovered from dead fish or detected under circumstances that confirm the mortality of the tagged hosts. All of these separate PIT tag mark and recovery events are reported to the Columbia Basin PIT Tag Information System (PTAGIS), where the individual events for each tag are catalogued in the PTAGIS database. Standardized methods have been developed to systematically record these mark and recovery tag events, and to ensure that the data are accurately and consistently reported to PTAGIS by contributors from dozens of agencies and organizations in the Columbia Basin. There is essentially no delay between the acquisition of these validated field data and their incorporation into the PTAGIS database. Researchers and resource managers have immediate access, through the PTAGIS Web Portal, to the comprehensive sets of individual and correlated PIT tag events reported in the Columbia Basin.},

Measures to rectify population declines include assessment of local extinction risk, population ecology, viability, and genetic differentiation. While conservation planning has been largely informed by neutral genetic structure, there has been a dearth of critical information regarding the role of non-neutral or functional genetic variation. We evaluated genetic variation among steelhead trout of the Columbia River Basin, which supports diverse populations distributed among dynamic landscapes. We categorized 188 SNP loci as either putatively neutral or candidates for divergent selection (non-neutral) using a multitest association approach. Neutral variation distinguished lineages and defined broad-scale population structure consistent with previous studies, but fine-scale resolution was also detected at levels not previously observed. Within distinct coastal and inland lineages, we identified nine and 22 candidate loci commonly associated with precipitation or temperature variables and putatively under divergent selection. Observed patterns of non-neutral variation suggest overall climate is likely to shape local adaptation (e.g., potential rapid evolution) of steelhead trout in the Columbia River region. Broad geographic patterns of neutral and non-neutral variation demonstrated here can be used to accommodate priorities for regional management and inform long-term conservation of this species.},

However, stock-specific rates of iteroparity and abundance of post-spawned steelhead ``kelts'' can be difficult to monitor in large river systems where multiple populations are commonly encountered as aggregated mixtures. We used genetic mixed-stock analysis (MSA) to determine steelhead origins and tested for stock-specific differences in the prevalence of an iterparous reproductive strategy. Steelhead from the Snake River, USA were sampled as ``returns'' migrating upstream to spawn and as emigrating post-spawned ``kelts''. Fish were assigned between two regions that are characterized by predominant run-type. We observed a larger overall proportion of kelts from region-1 (putative-A run; 82\%) compared to kelts from region-2 (putative B-run; 18\%), but returns from region-2 (30\%) were nearly twice as abundant as kelts. Female kelts were predominant throughout the basin, occurring in similar proportions between regions (72\% region-1, 77\% region-2). The inferred ocean age distribution of kelts was distinct between regions, and regional differences in body size and emigration timing were significant (P {$<$} 0.0001). Although the ocean age-classes for kelts and returns within the same region were similarly distributed, kelts were significantly smaller in average body size compared to returns, and the results were temporally consistent. The association between body size and post-spawn survival suggests that strategies to improve overall recovery of steelhead, such as artificial reconditioning, may achieve greater success by targeting smaller kelts. Moreover, monitoring of post-spawn survival, and repeat spawning potential will likely benefit from MSA to augment demographic information and improve the accuracy of differentiating among specific stocks or regions.},

Many factors contribute to genetic variation in O. mykiss populations, including sympatry among migratory phenotypes, habitat heterogeneity, hatchery introgression, and immigration (stray) rates. The relative influences of these and other factors are contingent on characteristics of the local environment. The Rock Creek subbasin in the middle Columbia River has no history of hatchery supplementation and no dams or artificial barriers. Limited intervention and minimal management have led to a dearth of information regarding the genetic distinctiveness of the extant O. mykiss population in Rock Creek and its tributaries. We used 192 SNP markers and collections sampled over a 5-y\- ear period to evaluate the temporal and spatial genetic structures of O. mykiss between upper and lower watersheds of the Rock Creek subbasin. We investigated potential limits to gene flow within the lower watershed where the stream is fragmented by seasonally dry stretches of streambed, and between upper and lower watershed regions. We found minor genetic differentiation within the lower watershed occupied by anadromous steelhead (FST = 0.004), and evidence that immigrant influences were prevalent and ubiquitous. Populations in the upper watershed above partial natural barriers were highly distinct (FST = 0.093) and minimally impacted by apparent introgression. Genetic structure between watersheds paralleled differences in local demographics (e.g., variation in size), migratory restrictions, and habitat discontinuity. The evidence of restricted gene flow between putative remnant resident populations in the upper watershed and the admixed anadromous population in the lower watershed has implications for local steelhead productivity and regional conservation.},

The aim of this study was to evaluate gene expression during early development in Oncorhynchus mykiss populations with different life histories, in a tissue known to integrate environmental cues to regulate complex developmental processes and behaviours. We sampled offspring produced from migrant and resident parents, collecting whole embryos prior to the beginning of first feeding, and brain tissue at three additional time points over the first year of development. RNA sequencing for 32 individuals generated a reference transcriptome of 30 177 genes that passed count thresholds. Differential gene expression between migrant and resident offspring was observed for 1982 genes. The greatest number of differentially expressed genes occurred at 8 months of age, in the spring a full year before the obvious physiological transformation from stream-dwelling parr to sea water-adaptable smolts begins for migrant individuals. Sex and age exhibited considerable effects on differential gene expression between migrants and resident offspring. Differential gene expression was observed in genes previously associated with migration, but also in genes previously unassociated with early life history divergence. Pathway analysis revealed coordinated differential expression in genes related to phototransduction, which could modulate photoperiod responsiveness and variation in circadian rhythms. The role for early differentiation in light sensitivity and biological rhythms is particularly intriguing in understanding early brain processes involved in differentiation of migratory and resident life history types.},

We successfully mapped 14,620 SNP loci including 2,336 paralogs in subtelomeric regions. This improved map was then used as a foundation to integrate genomic resources for gene annotation and population genomic analyses. We anchored a total of 286 scaffolds from the Atlantic salmon genome to the linkage map to provide a framework for the placement 11,728 Chinook salmon ESTs. Previously identified thermotolerance QTL were found to co-localize with several candidate genes including HSP70, a gene known to be involved in thermal response, as well as its inhibitor. Multiple regions of the genome with elevated divergence between populations were also identified, and annotation of ESTs in these regions identified candidate genes for fitness related traits such as stress response, growth, and behavior.

  abstract = {A common challenge for fisheries management is resolving the relative contribution of closely related populations where accuracy of genetic assignment may be limited. An overlooked method for increasing assignment accuracy is the use of multi-SNP (single nucleotide polymorphism) haplotypes rather than single-SNP genotypes. Haplotypes increase power for detecting population structure, and loci derived from next-generation sequencing methods often contain multiple SNPs. We evaluated the utility of multi-SNP haplotyping for mixture analysis in western Alaska Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha). Multi-SNP haplotype data increased the accuracy of mixture analysis for closely related populations by up to seven percentage points relative to single-SNP genotype data for a set of 500 loci; 90\% accuracy was achievable with as few as 150 loci with multi-SNP haplotypes but required at least 300 loci with single-SNP genotypes. Individual assignment to reporting groups showed an even greater increase in accuracy of up to 17 percentage points when multi-SNP haplotypes were used. Haplotyping multiple SNPs shows promise to improve the accuracy of assigning unknown fish to population of origin whenever haplotype data are available.},

  abstract = {Although water temperature is important to stream biota, it is difficult to collect in a spatially and temporally continuous fashion. We used remotely-sensed Land Surface Temperature (LST) data to estimate mean daily stream temperature for every confluence-to-confluence reach in the John Day River, OR, USA for a ten year period. Models were built at three spatial scales: site-specific, subwatershed, and basin-wide. Model quality was assessed using jackknife and cross-validation. Model metrics for linear regressions of the predicted vs. observed data across all sites and years: site-specific r2 = 0.95, Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) = 1.25 \H{}C; subwatershed r2 = 0.88, RMSE = 2.02 \H{}C; and basin-wide r2 = 0.87, RMSE = 2.12 \H{}C. Similar analyses were conducted using 2012 eight-day composite LST and eight-day mean stream temperature in five watersheds in the interior Columbia River basin. Mean model metrics across all basins: r2 = 0.91, RMSE = 1.29 \H{}C. Sensitivity analyses indicated accurate basin-wide models can be parameterized using data from as few as four temperature logger sites. This approach generates robust estimates of stream temperature through time for broad spatial regions for which there is only spatially and temporally patchy observational data, and may be useful for managers and researchers interested in stream biota.},

For regression, random forests give an accurate approximation of the conditional mean of a response variable. It is shown here that random forests provide information about the full conditional distribution of the response variable, not only about the conditional mean. Conditional quantiles can be inferred with quantile regression forests, a generalisation of random forests. Quantile regression forests give a non-parametric and accurate way of estimating conditional quantiles for high-dimensional predictor variables. The algorithm is shown to be consistent.

Analytical methods that assign individuals to their putative population of origin have utility in both basic and applied research, providing information about population-specific life history and habitat use, ecotoxins, pathogen and parasite loads, and many other non-genetic ecological, or phenotypic traits. Although the question is initially directed at the origin of individuals, in most cases the ultimate desire is to investigate the distribution of some trait among populations. Current practice is to assign individuals to a population of origin and study properties of the trait among individuals within population strata as if they constituted independent samples. It seemed that approach might bias population-specific trait inference. In this study we made trait inferences directly through modeling, bypassing individual assignment. We extended a Bayesian model for population mixture analysis to incorporate parameters for the phenotypic trait and compared its performance to that of individual assignment with a minimum probability threshold for assignment. The Bayesian mixture model outperformed individual assignment under some trait inference conditions. However, by discarding individuals whose origins are most uncertain, the individual assignment method provided a less complex analytical technique whose performance may be adequate for some common trait inference problems. Our results provide specific guidance for method selection under various genetic relationships among populations with different trait distributions.},

This is particularly the case in the Bay of Brest (France), where hatchery-based stock enhancement of P. maximus has been developed since 1983, in order to enhance the local population. However, The release of hatchery-born seeds might significantly impact the genetic diversity of local scallop populations. In the present study, microsatellites were used to monitor the genetic variability seeded great scallop populations, in order to evaluate the possible impact of hatchery-based stock enhancement on the genetic diversity of local populations. A limited but temporally persistent erosion of the genetic variability as well as a strong alteration of the natural gene pool were found in hatchery cohorts. However, the genetic diversity of seeded populations did not seem to decrease. Furthermore, molecular marker-based pedigrees were assessed, in order to identify hatchery-born individuals released in natural beds. Hatchery-born individuals were successfully assigned to their parents, thus opening new avenues for monitoring populations enhanced with hatchery-raised spat.},

Energy allocation strategy differences along a latitudinal gradient may suggest counter-gradient variation in energy storage for juvenile salmon, where higher latitude populations allocate more energy to storage than growth to satisfy greater energetic demands during winter in more northerly regions relative to southerly locations. Region-specific patterns in the relationship between energy density and body size of juvenile Chinook (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) and chum (O. keta) salmon from rivers in Oregon, Washington, and the Yukon River were investigated to identify if latitudinal position has an influence on the allometric relationship between energy density and body size. The allometric relationship between energy density and body size increased at a greater rate for both Chinook and chum salmon inhabiting higher latitudes, where longer, more severe winters occur. Juvenile Chinook had higher energy density than chum salmon across the latitudinal gradient, suggesting that energy stores may be more important for Chinook than for chum salmon. Gaining a better understanding of how spatially segregated populations of the same species are adapted to localized conditions can provide insight into how variability in environmental conditions and prey fields may act to improve or hinder growth and survival.},

Habitat complexity, redd density and the amount of observer experience were important in estimating error rates. Increases in both habitat complexity and experience reduced net error rates. Conversely, net error rates increased as redd density increased. Unbiased estimates of redd abundance were generated and converted to spawner abundance using population specific redd expansion factors.

  abstract = {Complex predator\textendash prey interactions over time have the potential to limit survival of threatened native species. Reservoirs created by large dams in temperate ecosystems are sites where both coldwater and warmwater fish species overlap in distributions, forming assemblages that would not occur under natural settings. For example, in many western North American reservoirs, juvenile native salmonids now overlap with native and non-native predators such as Northern Pikeminnow Ptychocheilus oregonensis and bass Micropterus spp. Currently, native Northern Pikeminnow are considered by many to be the most formidable predator of salmon smolts in freshwater systems of the Pacific Northwest. However, their consumption of salmon fry and the role of non-native warmwater predators remain unclear. Predation on fry has proved more difficult to identify than on smolts, due to smaller sizes and high digestibility, but is important for prioritizing management strategies. Here, we use multiple lines of evidence, including large datasets of stable isotopes and fish stomach contents, to identify which fish consume Chinook Salmon Oncorhynchus tshawytscha fry ({$<$}55 mm) as they enter reservoirs below their spawning grounds in the Middle Fork Willamette River, Oregon. Unexpectedly, we found that non-native warmwater game fishes, including bass and crappie Pomoxis spp., preyed more heavily on Chinook Salmon fry in the spring than native fish predators including Northern Pikeminnow. Of the native species, only Rainbow Trout Oncorhynchus mykiss showed evidence for significant predation on Chinook Salmon fry. Fish management in reservoirs that attempts to promote both warmwater and coldwater recreational fisheries simultaneously may thus be in conflict, necessitating future prioritization of species composition in individual reservoirs. This prioritization is especially important as these species include popular game fishes as well as salmonids threatened under the U.S. Endangered Species Act. Understanding predation pressure by popular invasive game fishes on sensitive life stages will allow managers and policymakers to evaluate trade-offs in the management of these novel assemblages.},

In temperate regions, streams can exhibit summer temperatures that exceed the optima for coolwater-adapted species relative to the amount of available food, and therefore, spring and fall may confer better growing conditions, especially for larger size classes. We examined the relationship between growth, consumption and growth efficiency across seasons in juvenile steelhead (Oncorhynchus mykiss) in their natal streams in Idaho, USA. Subyearling (0+) growth rates were higher in summer, whereas yearlings exhibited no statistically significant difference in growth between seasons. Consumption rates were overall lower in winter\textendash spring but constituted a higher proportion of maximum consumption compared with summer and fall, indicating better food availability relative to metabolic demands. Net growth efficiencies were higher in winter\textendash spring, but substantially more so than the proportion of maximum consumption. This suggests that overwinter growth performance was driven at least partly by higher growth efficiency, and the effect was most pronounced for yearling steelhead. The low proportions of maximum consumption for both age classes suggest that food was an overall limiting factor to growth, especially in summer when metabolic demands were highest. We discuss how temperature-based models can overestimate growth in the warmest parts of the year and develop a simple conceptual model for the seasonal timing of juvenile growth. In anadromous populations, the outmigration of presmolts in spring can reduce the level of competition. For the individuals that remain in the river, growth in this period can be particularly important.},

In particular, SNPs are dense throughout the genome of most organisms and are commonly observed in functional genes making them ideal markers to study adaptive molecular variation. This approach has become commonly employed in ecological and population genetics studies to detect outlier loci that are putatively under selection. However, there are several challenges to address with outlier approaches including genotyping errors, underlying population structure and false positives, variation in mutation rate and limited sensitivity (false negatives). In this study, we evaluated multiple outlier tests and their type I (false positive) and type II (false negative) error rates in a series of simulated data sets. Comparisons included simulation procedures (FDIST2, ARLEQUIN v.3.5 and BAYESCAN) as well as more conventional tools such as global FST histograms. Of the three simulation methods, FDIST2 and BAYESCAN typically had the lowest type II error, BAYESCAN had the least type I error and Arlequin had highest type I and II error. High error rates in Arlequin with a hierarchical approach were partially because of confounding scenarios where patterns of adaptive variation were contrary to neutral structure; however, Arlequin consistently had highest type I and type II error in all four simulation scenarios tested in this study. Given the results provided here, it is important that outlier loci are interpreted cautiously and error rates of various methods are taken into consideration in studies of adaptive molecular variation, especially when hierarchical structure is included.},

Evidence for adaptation was observed as expression of heat shock genes in fish from the desert population was more similar to control (unstressed) fish and significantly different (P 0.05) from those from the montane population, while F1 crosses were intermediate. High induction of heat shock proteins (Hsps) in the montane strain appeared to improve shortterm survival during first exposure to high water temperatures, but high physiological costs of Hsp production may have led to lower long-term survival. In contrast, the desert strain had significantly lower heat shock response than the montane fish and F1 crosses, suggesting that these desert fish have evolved alternative mechanisms to deal with thermal stress that provide better balance of physiological costs. Genomewide tests of greater than 10 000 SNPs found multiple SNPs that were significantly associated with survival under thermal stress, including Hsp47 which consistently appeared as a strong candidate gene for adaption to desert climates. Candidate SNPs identified in this study are prime targets to screen more broadly across this species' range to predict the potential for adaptation under scenarios of climate change. These results demonstrate that aquatic species can evolve adaptive responses to thermal stress and provide insight for understanding how climate change may impact ectotherms.},

In this study, we tested for differential transcriptional response of ecologically divergent populations of redband trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss gairdneri) that have evolved in desert and montane climates. Each pure strain and their F1 cross were reared in a common garden environment and exposed over four weeks to diel water temperatures that were similar to those experienced in desert climates within the species' range. Gill tissues were collected from the three strains of fish (desert, montane, F1 crosses) at the peak of heat stress and tested for mRNA expression differences across the transcriptome with RNA-seq. Results: Strong differences in transcriptomic response to heat stress were observed across strains confirming that fish from desert environments have evolved diverse mechanisms to cope with stressful environments. As expected, a large number of total transcripts (12,814) were differentially expressed in the study (FDR {$\leq$} 0.05) with 2310 transcripts in common for all three strains, but the desert strain had a larger number of unique differentially expressed transcripts (2875) than the montane (1982) or the F1 (2355) strain. Strongly differentiated genes ({$>$}4 fold change and FDR {$\leq$} 0.05) were particularly abundant in the desert strain (824 unique contigs) relative to the other two strains (montane = 58; F1 = 192). Conclusions: This study demonstrated patterns of acclimation (i.e., phenotypic plasticity) within strains and evolutionary adaptation among strains in numerous genes throughout the transcriptome. Key stress response genes such as molecular chaperones (i.e., heat shock proteins) had adaptive patterns of gene expression among strains, but also a much higher number of metabolic and cellular process genes were differentially expressed in the desert strain demonstrating these biological pathways are critical for thermal adaptation to warm aquatic climates. The results of this study further elucidate the molecular basis for thermal adaptation in aquatic ecosystems and extend the potential for identifying genes that may be critical for adaptation to changing climates.},

It is, however, difficult to directly estimate Ne from demographic data in many wild species. Alternatively, the use of genetic data has received much attention in recent years. In the present study, I propose a new method for estimating the effective number of breeders Neb from a parameter of allele sharing (molecular coancestry) among sampled progeny. The bias and confidence interval of the new estimator are compared with those from a published method, i.e. the heterozygote-excess method, using computer simulation. Two population models are simulated; the noninbred population that consists of noninbred and nonrelated parents and the inbred population that is composed of inbred and related parents. Both methods give essentially unbiased estimates of Neb when applied to the noninbred population. In the inbred population, the proposed method gives a downward biased estimate, but the confidence interval is remarkably narrowed compared with that in the noninbred population. Estimate from the heterozygote-excess method is nearly unbiased in the inbred population, but suffers from a larger confidence interval. By combining the estimates from the two methods as a harmonic mean, the reliability is remarkably improved.},

Fitness trade-offs can be linked to reproductive tactics that vary between the sexes, as well as the influence of environmental conditions. We found that O. mykiss outmigrants are more likely to be female in nine populations throughout western North America (grand mean 65\% female), in support of the hypothesis that anadromy is more likely to benefit females. This bias was not related to migration distance or freshwater productivity, as indicated by latitude. Within one O. mykiss population we also measured the resident sex ratio and did not observe a male bias, despite a high female bias among outmigrants in that system. We provide a simulation to demonstrate the relationship between sex ratios and the proportion of anadromy and show how sex ratios could be a valuable tool for predicting the prevalence of life history types in a population.},

  abstract = {Life history plasticity, particularly partial migration (i.e., coexistence of resident and anadromous forms), probably plays a major role in the ability of brown trout Salmo trutta to dominate food webs after introduction into Patagonian rivers. We documented brown trout establishment, distribution, and life history variation in relation to habitat features in the Rio Grande, Tierra del Fuego, Argentina. Results support the hypothesis that Rio Grande brown trout developed an anadromous life history form (``sea trout'') two decades after introduction in relation to localized food limitation as the population expanded throughout the basin. Tributary streams with only resident fish were narrower and had significantly higher levels of specific conductance and soluble reactive phosphorus than streams that were inhabited by both resident and anadromous brown trout. Invertebrate biomass was two to three times higher and juvenile brown trout density was significantly higher in resident-only sites than in streams with both life history forms. Density-dependent growth was not evident and juvenile condition was higher in resident-only streams. These findings suggest that food availability influences the individual decision to migrate, although genetic and other factors are probably also involved. Mark\textendash recapture analysis showed that approximately 38,000\textendash 55,000 adult sea trout returned annually to the Rio Grande in 2006 and 2007, making it one of the most robust sea trout populations in the world. However, native fishes have apparently declined to near extirpation as the brown trout population has expanded.},

Although home range size has been described for many taxa in two dimensions (2D), for species that also have a strong vertical component to their movement, such representations can miss core components of their ecology, including the size of their home ranges and the amount of overlap, and thus competition, between individuals. Measuring three-dimensional (3D) home ranges for small-bodied life history stages and species can be particularly difficult, as they cannot tolerate high resolution tracking technologies like GPS collars. In this study, we used Passive Integrated Transponder (PIT) tags to measure the 2D and 3D home ranges of two species of fossorial juvenile salamander: the ringed salamander (Ambystoma annulatum) and the spotted salamander (A. maculatum). We also tested whether individuals modified their habitat selection or movement behavior in response to environmental variation.},

Here, we tested a cost-effective alternative to individual genotyping, known as allelotyping, for identification of highly informative SNPs for accurate genetic stock identification. We estimated allele frequencies of 2880 SNPs from DNA pools of 23 Atlantic salmon populations using Illumina SNP-chip. We evaluated the performance of four common strategies (global FST, pairwise FST, Delta and outlier approach) for selection of the most informative set of SNPs and tested their effectiveness for GSI compared to random sets of SNP and microsatellite markers. For the majority of cases, SNPs selected using the outlier approach performed best followed by pairwise FST and Delta methods. Overall, the selection procedure reduced the number of SNPs required for accurate GSI by up to 53\% compared with randomly chosen SNPs. However, GSI accuracy was more affected by populations in the ascertainment group rather than the ranking method itself. We demonstrated for the first time the compatibility of different large-scale SNP datasets by compiling the largest population genetic dataset for Atlantic salmon to date. Finally, we showed an excellent performance of our top SNPs on an independent set of populations covering the main European distribution range of Atlantic salmon. Taken together, we demonstrate how combination of DNA pooling and SNP arrays can be applied for conservation and management of salmonids as well as other species.},

Females made up 76-100\% of northern squawfish 380 mm fork length or greater in individualreservoirs, and 87-99\% of fish 380 mm or greater in the three combined areas. Females lived longer and grew faster than males in all reservoirs and areas and had lower annual mortality rates in all but two reservoirs. Proportional stock density was highest and annual mortality rates were generally lowest in Columbia River reservoirs. Northern squawfish downstream from Bonneville Dam had a lower mean relative weight and higher relative fecundity (eggs per unit fish weight) than populations in impoundments. Snake River populations had the highest mortality rales but exhibited intermediate values for other population parameters. None of the biological characteristics were strongly correlated with density of northern squawfish except relative fecundity. Differences in life history traits of northern squawfish among reservoirs and between free-flowing and impounded reaches underscore the ability of northern squawfish to adapt to altered conditions. Spatial heterogeneity in population characteristics creates uncertainty regarding the effects and relative benefits of a northern squawfishmanagement program to reduce predation on juvenile salmonids.},

  abstract = {Understanding the genetic structure of species is essential for conservation. It is only with this information that managers, academics, user groups and land-use planners can understand the spatial scale of migration and local adaptation, source-sink dynamics and effective population size. Such information is essential for a multitude of applications including delineating management units, balancing management priorities, discovering cryptic species and implementing captive breeding programmes. Species can range from locally adapted by hundreds of metres (Pavey et al. 2010) to complete species panmixia (Co\^te  et al. 2013). Even more remarkable is that this essential information can be obtained without fully sequenced or annotated genomes, but from mere (putatively) nonfunctional variants. First with allozymes, then microsatellites and now SNPs, this neutral genetic variation carries a wealth of information about migration and drift. For many of us, it may be somewhat difficult to remember our understanding of species conservation before the widespread usage of these useful tools. However most species on earth have yet to give us that `peek under the curtain'. With the current diversity on earth estimated to be nearly 9 million species (Mora et al. 2011), we have a long way to go for a comprehensive meta-phylogeographic understanding. A method presented in this issue by Campbell and colleagues (Campbell et al. 2015) is a tool that will accelerate the pace in this area. Genotyping-in-thousands (GT-seq) leverages recent advancements in sequencing technology to save many hours and dollars over previous methods to generate this important neutral genetic information.},

We used experiments conducted in a laboratory stream channel to document behavioral interactions that occur when hatchery salmon are stocked to streams containing existing natural chinook salmon juveniles. We found that natural fish aggression was suppressed when hatchery fish were larger than natural fish in the spring and summer, and the aggressiveness of natural fish increased when paired with similar sized hatchery fish during fall. Types of micro-habitat used by natural chinook salmon were mainly affected by hatchery fish during the fall trials when more natural fish were found in open pool areas, and fewer used cobble cover when hatchery fish were present. Observed behavioral shifts by natural chinook salmon parr could increase energy expenditures and exposure to predators when hatchery fish are present, but there were few consistent effects from hatchery salmon on the growth or movement patterns of natural chinook salmon during this study. Relative fish size, increased stream densities, and the behavior of the hatchery salmon appeared to be a major factors influencing observed changes in the behavior of juvenile natural chinook salmon in the stream sections.},

Within the stream-type lineage, there exists two juvenile migratory tactics; those leaving their natal tributaries as subyearlings prior to winter (presmolts) and, those emigrating from their natal areas 1 year after emergence (smolts). Within the upper Salmon River, Idaho, a research gap currently exists for presmolts that emigrate from the Lemhi River during fall and winter into the mainstem Salmon River, specifically in regard to overwinter movement, distribution, and habitat use. Using recently developed 0.5 g micro radio transmitters, 150 presmolts in the Lemhi River were implanted with tags, allowing for movement and distribution monitoring over the 2018-2019 winter in the mainstem Salmon River. Using a Cormack-Jolly-Seber model, we estimated that 2 radio-tagged presmolts transitioned (survived and moved with a live transmitter) through the Frank Church River of No Return Wilderness area of the Salmon River during the first 2 months with an overall transition probability of 1.4\%. Transition probabilities dropped 9\% upon entering a slack water area (Deadwater), 12\% upon entering a canyon section of the Salmon River, and 58\% reduction after entering the wilderness section of the Salmon River (likely due to battery failure or finding an area to overwinter). The mean travel speed was 5.6 km/d over 246 km. Further investigation will continue to assess movement and distribution of presmolts in the mainstem Salmon River over the next three years. This information will aid in addressing data gaps regarding use of mainstem winter rearing habitats by presmolts. Additionally, this project will assess habitat utilization of Chinook salmon smolts in natal tributaries.},

  abstract = {Chinook salmon Oncorhynchus tshawytscha have two evolutionarily distinct life history types: ocean-type and stream-type. Within the stream-type lineage, there exists two juvenile migratory tactics; those leaving their natal tributaries as subyearlings prior to winter (presmolts) and those emigrating from their natal areas 1 year after emergence (smolts). A gap in knowledge exists in the life history of juveniles regarding overwintering movement, distribution, and habitat use. Currently, we are in the third-year of a four-year study using new technology to determine overwinter survival and habitat selection of juvenile Chinook salmon. In October 2019, 282 pre-smolts in the Lemhi River at three collection locations upper Lemhi RST (LEMTRP), Hayden Creek RST (HYDTRP), and lower Lemhi RST (LLRTP) were implanted with 0.3 g radio transmitters to monitor movement and distribution over the 2019-2020 winter in the Salmon River. Using a Cormack-Jolly-Seber model in a Bayesian framework, we estimated detection probability at each fixed telemetry site, as well as the transition probability between each site (i.e. the probability that a fish will survive and move downstream). Cumulative transition probabilities dropped sharply upon entering the area just downstream of the LEMTRP tagging and again in a rehabilitation project area with quality habitat. The same areas also had some of the lowest estimated site to site transition probabilities with the addition of Salmon River Ranch to Colson Creek in the mainstem of the Salmon River. These lower transition probabilities may represent areas that juveniles occupied and therefore did not move downstream because of the quality habitat within these sites. We observed Chinook salmon presmolts throughout the lower Lemhi River using mobile telemetry a total of 66 times (habitat use events) with pools, terrestrial vegetation, and fine substrate being observed at the largest proportion of habitat use locations. These mobile surveys answered some of the questions regarding what these fish are doing between fixed sites while creating further questions of the fate of transmitters. Further investigation will continue to assess movement and distribution of presmolts in the mainstem Salmon River and Lemhi River in 2020-2021. This information will aid in addressing data gaps regarding use of mainstem winter rearing habitats by presmolts. Additionally, this project will continue to assess habitat availability and use of juvenile Chinook salmon in the lower Lemhi River to determine preferred habitat and inform target habitat conditions.},

  abstract = {Genetic stock identification is a widely applied tool for the mixed-stock management of salmonid species throughout the North Pacific Rim. The effectiveness of genetic stock identification is dependent on the level of differentiation among stocks which is often high due to the life history of these species that involves high homing fidelity to their natal streams. However, the utility of this tool can be reduced when natural genetic structuring has been altered by hatchery translocation and/or supplementation. We examined the genetic population structure of ESA-listed steelhead in the Snake River basin of the United States. We analyzed 9,613 natural-origin adult steelhead returning to Passive Integrated Transponder detection sites throughout the basin from 2010 through 2017. Individuals were genotyped at 180 single nucleotide polymorphic genetic markers and grouped into 20 populations based on their return location. While we expected to observe a common pattern of hierarchical genetic structuring due to isolation by distance, we observed low genetic differentiation between populations in the upper Salmon River basin compared to geographically distant populations in the lower Snake River basin. These results were consistent with lower genetic stock assignment probabilities observed for populations in this upper basin. We attribute these patterns of reduced genetic structure to the translocation of lower basin steelhead stocks and ongoing hatchery programs in the upper Salmon River basin. We discuss the implications of these findings on the utility of genetic stock identification in the basin and discuss opportunities for increasing assignment probabilities in the face of low genetic structure.},

The first is the topic of scientific specialization. How do we steer a course between being a dilettante on one hand, dabbling in everything without making major contributions in any field, and on the other hand being a specialist who digs deeply but too narrowly? The second theme is the concept of specialization with respect to place, and the study of natural history. It can be incredibly rewarding, both personally and professionally, to develop a rich ecological understanding of a particular place such as a field station. However, this requires a great commitment of time, and it reduces mobility and experience elsewhere. The third theme is the importance of mentoring and the transfer of encouragement and opportunity from one cohort to the next. I will address these three themes in this order but they are closely linked to each other, making the separation somewhat artificial.},

  abstract = {Landscape genomics is an emerging research field that aims to identify the environmental factors that shape adaptive genetic variation and the gene variants that drive local adaptation. Its development has been facilitated by next-generation sequencing, which allows for screening thousands to millions of single nucleotide polymorphisms in many individuals and populations at reasonable costs. In parallel, data sets describing environmental factors have greatly improved and increasingly become publicly accessible. Accordingly, numerous analytical methods for environmental association studies have been developed. Environmental association analysis identifies genetic variants associated with particular environmental factors and has the potential to uncover adaptive patterns that are not discovered by traditional tests for the detection of outlier loci based on population genetic differentiation. We review methods for conducting environmental association analysis including categorical tests, logistic regressions, matrix correlations, general linear models and mixed effects models. We discuss the advantages and disadvantages of different approaches, provide a list of dedicated software packages and their specific properties, and stress the importance of incorporating neutral genetic structure in the analysis. We also touch on additional important aspects such as sampling design, environmental data preparation, pooled and reducedrepresentation sequencing, candidate-gene approaches, linearity of allele\textendash environment associations and the combination of environmental association analyses with traditional outlier detection tests. We conclude by summarizing expected future directions in the field, such as the extension of statistical approaches, environmental association analysis for ecological gene annotation, and the need for replication and post hoc validation studies.},

Although the inventory of species is continually increasing, as registered by the Census of Marine Life program, only about 10\% of the estimated two million marine species are known. This lag between observed and estimated diversity is in part due to the elusiveness of most aquatic species and the technical difficulties of exploring extreme environments, as for instance the abyssal plains and polar waters. In the last decade, the rapid development of affordable and flexible high-throughput sequencing approaches have been helping to improve our knowledge of marine biodiversity, from the rich microbial biota that forms the base of the tree of life to a wealth of plant and animal species. In this review, we present an overview of the applications of genomics to the study of marine life, from evolutionary biology of non-model organisms to species of commercial relevance for fishing, aquaculture and biomedicine. Instead of providing an exhaustive list of available genomic data, we rather set to present contextualized examples that best represent the current status of the field of marine genomics.},

  abstract = {Despite significant investments in watershed-scale restoration projects, evaluation of their impacts on salmonids is often limited by inadequate experimental design. This project aimed to strengthen study designs by identifying and quantifying sources of temporal and spatial uncertainty while assessing population-level salmonid responses in Before-After-Control-Impact (BACI) restoration experiments. To evaluate sources of temporal uncertainty, meta-analysis of 32 annual BACI experiments from the Pacific Northwest, USA was conducted. Experimental error was determined to be a function of the total temporal variation of both restoration and control salmonid population metrics and the degree of covariation, or synchrony, between these metrics (r2 = 1). However, synchrony was both weak ({$\rho$} = 0.18) and unrelated to experimental error (r = 0.01) while temporal variability was found to account for 91\% of this error. Because synchrony did not reduce experimental error, we conclude that BACI designs will not normally exhibit greater power over uncontrolled Before-After (BA) designs. To evaluate spatial uncertainty, hierarchical BACI designs were simulated. It was found that spatial variability of hypothetical steelhead (Oncorhynchus mykiss) growth values within watersheds can cause mis-estimation of the restoration effect and reduce power. While hierarchical BACI designs can examine both reach and watershed-scale restoration effects simultaneously, due to probable mis-estimation of the restoration effect size, these scales should be examined separately. Paired-reach designs such as Extensive Post-Treatment (EPT) provide powerful replicated local-scale restoration experiments, which can build understanding of restoration-ecological mechanisms. Knowledge gained from reach-scale experiments should then be implemented on watershed-scales and monitored within a non-hierarchical framework.},

This has proven particularly challenging for large restoration programs focused on recovery of threatened and endangered salmon and trout where numerous tools, models, and other assessments have been developed to assist with habitat restoration at the watershed, reach, and project scale. Unfortunately, it is often unclear which step in the restoration process various assessment tools will actually address. To assist with identifying the appropriate assessment tool (e.g., model, data collection, analysis, and survey), we reviewed major categories of watershed restoration assessment tools to determine their goals, inputs, outputs, and their utility in helping plan, prioritize, and implement restoration actions. The major categories of assessment tools reviewed included: 1) life-cycle and fish-habitat models, 2) watershed assessment methods and techniques, 3) reach assessments, 4) prioritization tools, and 5) common monitoring methods to identify, prioritize, and plan river and watershed restoration projects. We specifically indicated whether they directly or indirectly assisted with the key steps in the restoration process that are required to develop successful restoration plans and projects including: assessing watershed conditions, identifying limiting habitats and life stages, identifying problems and restoration actions, selecting restoration techniques, prioritizing restoration actions, or designing actual restoration projects. It is important to recognize that no single assessment tool will address all the steps in the restoration process. Selecting appropriate assessment tools requires a clear understanding of the goals of the restoration program and which step in the restoration process will be addressed by a particular tool. We close with recommendations for how restoration practitioners and managers can use our review to help select the appropriate assessment tools needed for their watershed.},

Understanding the potential effects of introduced Smallmouth Bass is essential to efficiently direct salmon management efforts, especially given the potential for upstream range expansion of Smallmouth Bass in response to the climate-induced warming that many rivers may experience. However, the predatory and competitive threats of Smallmouth Bass to juvenile salmonids remain largely unexamined, particularly in salmon rearing areas. To address this knowledge gap, we collected stable isotope ({$\delta$}13C and {$\delta$}15N) and fatty acid data to assess the trophic role of Smallmouth Bass in the upstream reaches of the North Fork John Day River, a tributary of the Columbia River where the upstream invasion extent of Smallmouth Bass co-occurs with the native predator Northern Pikeminnow and river-rearing juvenile Chinook Salmon. We found that Smallmouth Bass and Northern Pikeminnow occupy divergent dietary niches, and there was little evidence of a strong predation or competition threat to juvenile Chinook Salmon from either predator. In addition, we found a disproportionate reliance on autochthonous resources across the entire community and low isotopic uniqueness, suggesting potential competition among the broader fish community given the scarcity of resources. Importantly, this study focused on the overlap between the upstream-most habitats of encroaching Smallmouth Bass and downstream-most habitats of juvenile Chinook Salmon. Therefore, the relative scarcity of rearing salmon in comparison with other available prey in this zone may limit current predation threats. The results from this study help guide resource-limited managers that are tasked with conserving and restoring native salmonid populations.}

In contrast to less populous species of salmon, these species are more abundant now than ever, averaging 665 \texttimes{} 106 adult salmon each year (1.32 \texttimes{} 106 metric tons) during 1990\textendash 2015. When immature salmon are included, recent biomass estimates approach 5 \texttimes{} 106 metric tons. Following an initial peak during 1934\textendash 1943, abundances were low until the 1977 regime shift benefited each species. During 1990\textendash 2015, Pink Salmon dominated adult abundance (67\% of total) and biomass (48\%), followed by Chum Salmon (20\%, 35\%) and Sockeye Salmon (13\%, 17\%). Alaska produced approximately 39\% of all Pink Salmon, 22\% of Chum Salmon, and 69\% of Sockeye Salmon, while Japan and Russia produced most of the remainder. Although production of natural-origin salmon is currently high due to generally favorable ocean conditions in northern regions, approximately 60\% of Chum Salmon, 15\% of Pink Salmon, and 4\% of Sockeye Salmon during 1990\textendash 2015 were of hatchery origin. Alaska generated 68\% and 95\% of hatchery Pink Salmon and Sockeye Salmon, respectively, while Japan produced 75\% of hatchery Chum Salmon. Salmon abundance in large areas of Alaska (Prince William Sound and Southeast Alaska), Russia (Sakhalin and Kuril islands), Japan, and South Korea are dominated by hatchery salmon. During 1990\textendash 2015, hatchery salmon represented approximately 40\% of the total biomass of adult and immature salmon in the ocean. Density-dependent effects are apparent, and carrying capacity may have been reached in recent decades, but interaction effects between hatchery- and natural-origin salmon are difficult to quantify, in part because these fish are rarely separated in catch and escapement statistics. The following management changes are recommended: (1) mark or tag hatchery salmon so that they can be identified after release, (2) estimate hatchery- and natural-origin salmon in catches and escapement, and (3) maintain these statistics in publicly accessible databases.},

  abstract = {Managing weak stocks in mixed-stock fisheries often relies on proxies derived from data-rich indicator stocks, although there have been limited tests of the appropriateness of such proxies. For example, full cohort reconstruction of tagged Klamath River fall-run Chinook Salmon Oncorhynchus tshawytscha of northern California enables the use of detailed models to inform management. Information gained from this stock is also used in the management of the untagged, threatened California Coastal Chinook Salmon (CCC) stock, where it is assumed that a cap on Klamath harvest rates effectively constrains impacts on CCC to acceptable levels. To evaluate use of this proxy, we used a novel approach based on genetic stock identification (GSI) data to compare the two stocks' size at age and ocean distribution (as inferred from spatial variation in CPUE), two key factors influencing fishery exposure. We developed broadly applicable methods to account for both sampling and genetic assignment uncertainty in estimating total stock-specific catch from GSI data, and propagated this uncertainty into models quantifying variation in CPUE across space and time. We found that, in 2010, the stocks were similar in size at age early in the year (age 3 and age 4), but CCC fish were larger later in the year. The stocks appeared similarly distributed early in the year (2010) but more concentrated near their respective source rivers later in the year (2010 and 2011). If these results are representative, relative fishery impacts on the two stocks might scale similarly early in the year, but management changes later in the year could have differing impacts on the two stocks. This novel modeling approach is suited to evaluating the concordance between other data-limited stocks and their proxies, and can be broadly applied to estimate stock-specific harvest, and the uncertainty therein, using GSI in other systems.},

Spatial and temporal distributions inferred from GSI sampling of stocks with tagged hatchery components were broadly consistent with those previously inferred from studies of tag recoveries alone, while GSI provided additional insight into untagged stocks of conservation concern. The catch in all times and areas was dominated (typically {$\geq$}90\%) by the ``Central Valley Fall'' genetic reporting group, which is comprised primarily of Sacramento River fall run Chinook. Other contributing stocks were more spread out in space and time with the exception of Central Valley winter run Chinook, which were rarely encountered by boats fishing in port areas north of Point Reyes. Localized stock-specific CPUE appeared to increase near a stock's respective natal river while decreasing in other port areas at the time of adult return to freshwater for spawning. We describe methods for quantifying uncertainty in stock proportions, stock-specific catch, and determining the statistical support for proposed management boundaries hypothesized to represent ``break points'' in the spatial distributions for stocks of concern, and find at most equivocal support for a proposed delineation line at Point Reyes in north-central California.},

We analyzed mortality patterns using methods that incorporated downriver reference populations passing fewer dams, and temporal approaches that were independent of reference populations. Our results from the alternative spatial and temporal methods consistently corroborated with spawner\textendash recruit residuals and smolt-to-adult survival rate data sets, indicating that Snake River salmon survived about one quarter as well as the reference populations. Temporal analysis indicated that a high percentage (76\%) of Snake River juvenile salmon that survived the FCRPS subsequently died in the marine environment as a result of their outmigration experience. Through this and previous studies, it is evident that delayed hydrosystem mortality increases with the number of powerhouse passages and decreases with the speed of outmigration. Therefore, a promising conservation approach would be to explore management experiments that evaluate these relationships by increasing managed spill levels at the dams during the spring migration period.},

  abstract = {Stream restoration practice typically relies on a geomorphological design approach in which the integration of ecological criteria is limited and generally qualitative, although the most commonly stated project objective is to restore biological integrity by enhancing habitat and water quality. Restoration has achieved mixed results in terms of ecological successes and it is evident that improved methodologies for assessment and design are needed. A design approach is suggested for mesohabitat restoration based on a review and integration of fundamental processes associated with: (1) lotic ecological concepts; (2) applied geomorphic processes for mesohabitat self-maintenance; (3) multidimensional hydraulics and habitat suitability modeling; (4) species functional traits correlated with fish mesohabitat use; and (5) multi-stage ecohydraulics-based mesohabitat classification. Classification of mesohabitat units demonstrated in this article were based on fish preferences specifically linked to functional trait strategies (i.e., feeding resting, evasion, spawning, and flow refugia), recognizing that habitat preferences shift by season and flow stage. A multi-stage classification scheme developed under this premise provides the basic ``building blocks'' for ecological design criteria for stream restoration. The scheme was developed for Midwest US prairie streams, but the conceptual framework for mesohabitat classification and functional traits analysis can be applied to other ecoregions.},

A variety of modeling approaches are used for status and trend monitoring of anadromous species throughout the Pacific Northwest, USA, but current methods may fail to capture the complex relationship between fish and habitat and are often limited in predictive power beyond specific watersheds. Further, the focus on species distribution and abundance is not easily manipulated to predict carrying capacity and traditional stock-recruitment analyses are reliant on longterm data which are not always available. In this study, we developed a quantile random forest model to provide estimates of habitat carrying capacity for Chinook salmon (O. tshawytscha) parr during the summer months, at both the site and watershed scale. Quantile random forest models allow for the consideration of noisy data, correlated variables, and non-linear relationships: common features in fish\textendash habitat datasets. We leveraged Columbia Habitat Monitoring Program data to select habitat co-variates and predict capacity at those sites. We also identified a set of globally available attributes to extrapolate capacity estimate predictions throughout wadeable streams within the Columbia River basin. Total capacity estimates for watersheds closely matched estimates from alternative fish productivity models. Carrying capacity estimates based on quantile random forest models, like those presented here, provide managers a framework to guide the identification, prioritization, and development of habitat rehabilitation actions to recover salmon populations.},

We also demonstrated that when sampling of spawners was incomplete, an estimated PBT rate for the offspring could also be predicted with fewer than 100 SNPs. This study in the Snake River basin is one of the first large-scale implementations of PBT in salmonids and lays the foundation for adopting this technology more broadly in the region, thereby allowing the unprecedented ability to mark millions of smolts and an opportunity to address a variety of parentage-based research and management questions.},

We developed a run reconstruction method for fall Chinook salmon returning to Lower Granite Dam on the Snake River. We showed that composition estimates of fish returning to large river systems can be obtained through subsampling. The methods reported here yield CIs around those estimates. We used compound bootstrap methods to derive CIs and SEs on return numbers and composition. In general, if the number of fish returning for a group was 300 or more, we were 90\% confident that our return estimate represented the true number within 10\%. Estimates for smaller groups were generally imprecise. The analytical technique described here provides fishery managers with information necessary for assessing escapement and recovery goals and addressing conservation and harvest allocations of adult Snake River fall Chinook salmon.},

We examined the accuracy and precision of estimators of composition of wild steelhead (Oncorhynchus mykiss) in the Snake River, in the Pacific Northwest. We simulated estimators, using pooled and time-stratified data. We compared confidence intervals (CIs) determined on the basis of asymptotical normality or a 2-stage bootstrap method. Stratified estimators were unbiased, except in a few cases. Joint CIs (all groups considered simultaneously) had coverages near nominal. Conversely, pooled estimators performed poorly; the proportion of biased estimates increased as the number of groups estimated increased. Using empirical data, we show that CIs met precision goals for most groups. Half-widths of CIs decreased and stabilized as the number sampled and group abundance increased. In complex scenarios, estimates of small groups will yield poor precision and some may be biased, but a stratified estimate with a conservative joint CI can be of practical use. The 2-step bootstrap approach is flexible and can incorporate other sources of variability or sampling constraints.},

  abstract = {Hatchery reared steelhead often have lower fitness than natural-origin fish when spawning in the wild. Fitness loss in hatcheries is partly due to genetic adaptation to captivity (domestication), but the underlying selection pressures driving adaptation remain unknown. Circumstantial evidence suggests that adaptation to hatcheries is accelerated when fish are reared at high density. We hypothesized two mechanisms by which high rearing densities could accelerate adaptation to the hatchery. First, high density could increase the among-family component of variation in fork length, which could increase the opportunity for selection after release. Second, a growth tradeoff in fork length among families could occur across densities (family-by-environment interaction). We raised the same set of families, in replicate, at each of two densities. We found main effects of density (high density reduced body size) and family (accounts for 33-53\% of variance in size at release) on juvenile fork length. However, high density did not increase the percentage of variance in fork length among families, and there was weak evidence for a family-by-environment interaction. We propose an alternate model of how increased density might exacerbate domestication selection. The relationship between size at release and probability of survival is strongly non-linear (almost truncational) for steelhead. Because high density decreases the fork lengths of all families approximately equally, high density could simply reduce the number of families that are above a threshold for high survival, resulting in strong among-family selection after release from the hatchery.},

  abstract = {Conservation-focused reintroduction or supplementation programs using wild-born individuals tend to be more successful than those based on release of captive-born individuals. Negative genetic consequences of captive breeding, such as genetic diversity loss, domestication selection, and inbreeding, may contribute to this lowered success. In this study, we compare genetic consequences of repatriation, or collection of wild-born juveniles for captive rearing and release, and broodstock-based breeding, where wild adults are bred in captivity, in a conservation program for white sturgeon, Acipenser transmontanus. Specifically, we use microsatellite markers to compare the genetic diversity and number of spawners, \-Ns, represented by each captive breeding strategy. We present a novel method to estimate N\- s in which simulated known family configurations of varying complexity are used to identify appropriate inclusive and exclusive probability thresholds in the maximum likelihood-based pedigree reconstruction program Colony. These probability thresholds are then applied to reconstruct progeny arrays and estimate N\- s in empirical datasets of two repatriation cohorts and a naturally produced year class. We find that a repatriation approach preserves more genetic diversity and represents more spawners than broodstockbased captive breeding. Furthermore, a repatriation approach represents levels of genetic diversity similar to those found in a wild cohort. These results are the first comparison of N\- s between broodstock and repatriation-based methods with respect to a hatchery program, and provide evidence that when possible, repatriation can be a more effective strategy for conserving genetic diversity than broodstock-based breeding for supplementation and reintroduction.},

  abstract = {Stream biophysical processes are commonly studied using multi-dimensional numerical modelling that quantifies flow hydraulics from which parameters such as habitat suitability, stream carrying capacity, and bed mobility are derived. These analyses would benefit from accurate high-resolution stream bathymetries spanning tens of kilometres of channel, especially in small streams or where navigation is difficult. Traditional ground-based survey methods are limited by survey time, dense vegetation and stream access, and are usually only feasible for short reaches. Conversely, airborne topobathymetric LiDAR surveys may overcome these limitations, although limited research is available on how errors in LiDAR-derived digital elevation models (DEMs) might propagate through flow models. This study investigated the performance of LiDAR-derived topobathymetry in support of multi-dimensional flow modelling and ecohydraulics calculations in two gravel-bedded reaches (approximately 200m long), one morphologically complex and one morphologically simple, and at the segment scale (32km-long stream segment) along a 15m-wide river in central Idaho, USA. We compared metre and sub-metre-resolution DEMs generated from RTK-GPS ground and Experimental Advanced Airborne Research LiDAR-B (EAARL-B) surveys and water depths, velocities, shear stresses, habitat suitability, and bed mobility modelled with two-dimensional (2D) hydraulic models supported by LiDAR and ground-surveyed DEMs. Residual statistics, bias (B), and standard deviation (SD) of the residuals between depth and velocity predicted from the model supported by LiDAR and ground-survey topobathymetries were up to \`A0.04 (B) and 0.09m (SD) for depth and \`A0.09 (B) and 0.20ms\`A1 (SD) for velocity. The accuracy (B = 0.05m), precision (SD = 0.09m), and point density (1 pointm\`A2) of the LiDAR topobathymetric survey (regardless of reach complexity) were sufficient to support 2D hydrodynamic modelling and derivative stream habitat and process analyses, because these statistics were comparable to those of model calibration with B = 0m and SD = 0.04m for water surface elevation and B=0.05ms\`A1 and SD=0.22ms\`A1 for velocity in our investigation. \textcopyright{} 2020 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

  abstract = {In recent decades, the marine production of Asian and North American Pacific salmon and steelhead populations has undergone significant variability linked to climate change. Improved forecasts of the abundance and distribution of salmon are needed that will benefit stock management in all salmon producing countries around the North Pacific Rim. The North Pacific Anadromous Fish Commission (NPAFC) Science Plan is a long-term comprehensive strategy for international cooperative research. The primary goal of the 2011\textendash 2015 Science Plan was to explain and forecast annual variations in Pacific salmon production. The plan was developed with an overarching research theme ``Forecast of Pacific Salmon Production in the Ocean Ecosystems under Changing Climate'' and five research topics. This paper describes progress made on each research topic and the overarching theme, much of which was assessed at an international symposium in Kobe, Japan, on May 17\textendash 19, 2015. In summary, the reliability of stock identification methods including genetic and otolith mark analyses has improved, enabling better monitoring of stock-specific ocean distribution and abundance. Salmon marine survival depends on early marine coastal environments but also on conditions later in life, including winter. Models incorporating fish mortality and various environmental factors improve our ability to forecast returns of specific salmon stocks. However, limitations on our ability to accurately explain and forecast annual variations in Pacific salmon production remain, in part because of uncertainty in the factors responsible for salmon mortality and from the effects of climate warming on the marine distribution and abundance of salmon. It is more important than ever to promote cooperative and innovative international research to identify and better understand the ecological mechanisms regulating the distribution and abundance of salmon populations for sustainable salmon and steelhead management.},

  abstract = {Identifying and understanding temporal genetic changes within fish populations is important for the management of these populations, especially those of conservation concern. Such changes are often the result of genetic drift, which can be exacerbated when the size of a population decreases. Using molecular-genetics techniques, we monitored nine populations of Chinook salmon Oncorhynchus tshawytscha in the Salmon River, Idaho, to determine how the genetic characteristics within and among these populations have changed over time. We found no evidence of change in the level of heterozygosity or allelic richness over three to four generations in eight of the populations. This is probably due to the fact that the populations all maintained a sufficiently large effective size, even though a few of the populations did show a decline in effective size. Also, the genetic structure among the populations did not change appreciably over time. Populations that had been supplemented with hatchery-reared fish showed genetic similarity to the within-basin hatchery source population, presumably because of the extensive use of native fish for hatchery brood stocks and minimal out-of-basin stock transfers. The lack of a detectable decline in these populations' levels of genetic diversity is encouraging, given the species' threatened status under the U.S. Endangered Species Act.},

  abstract = {This study describes the functioning of a novel sensor to measure cortisol concentration in the interstitial fluid (ISF) of a human subject. ISF is extracted by means of vacuum pressure from micropores created on the stratum corneum layer of the skin. The pores are produced by focusing a near infrared laser on a layer of black dye material attached to the skin. The pores are viable for approximately three days after skin poration. Cortisol measurements are based on electrochemical impedance (EIS) technique. Gold microelectrode arrays functionalized with Dithiobis (succinimidyl propionate) self-assembled monolayer (SAM) have been used to fabricate an ultrasensitive, disposable, electrochemical cortisol immunosensor. The biosensor was successfully used for in-vitro measurement of cortisol in ISF. Tests in a laboratory setup show that the sensor exhibits a linear response to cortisol concentrations in the range 1 pm to 100 nM. A small pilot clinical study showed that in-vitro immunosensor readings, when compared with commercial evaluation using enzyme-linked immunoassay (ELISA) method, correlated well with cortisol levels in saliva and ISF. Further, circadian rhythm could be established between the subject's ISF and the saliva samples collected over 24 hours time-period. Cortisol levels in ISF were found reliably higher than in saliva. This Research establishes the feasibility of using impedance based biosensor architecture for a disposable, wearable cortisol detector. The projected commercial invivo real-time cortisol sensor device, besides being minimally invasive, will allow continuous ISF harvesting and cortisol monitoring over 24 hours even when the subject is asleep. Forthcoming, this sensor could be interfaced to a wireless health monitoring system that could transfer sensor data over existing wide-area networks such as the internet and a cellular phone network to enable real-time remote monitoring of subjects.},

One such disturbance is water diversions, which can entrain fish and alter streamflow regimes. Threatened Lemhi River (Idaho) Chinook salmon O. tshawytscha smolts encounter 41\textendash 71 water diversions during their out-migration. We used passive integrated transponder tag data to model the entrainment rate of Chinook salmon smolts as a function of the proportion of water removed by an irrigation diversion. Under median-streamflow conditions with unscreened diversions, the estimated cumulative effect of the diversions was a loss of 71.1\% of out-migrating smolts due to entrainment. This is a large potential source of mortality, but screening is an effective mitigation strategy, as estimated mortality was reduced to 1.9\% when all diversions were screened. If resources are limited, targeting the diversions that remove a large amount of water and diversions in locations with high fish encounter rates is most effective. Our modeling approach could be used to quantify the entrainment effects of water diversions and set screening priorities for other watersheds.},

In the Lemhi Basin, Idaho (U.S.A.), water diversion causes changes in streamflow, and climate change will further affect streamflow and temperature. Shifts in streamflow and temperature regimes can affect juvenile salmon growth, movement, and survival. We examined the potential effects of water diversion and climate change on juvenile Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha), a species listed as threatened under the U.S. Endangered Species Act (ESA). To examine the effects for juvenile survival, we created a model relating 19 years of juvenile survival data to streamflow and temperature and found spring streamflow and summer temperature were good predictors of juvenile survival. We used these models to project juvenile survival for 15 diversion and climate-change scenarios. Projected survival was 42\textendash 58\% lower when streamflows were diverted than when streamflows were undiverted. For diverted streamflows, 2040 climate-change scenarios (ECHO-G and CGCM3.1 T47) resulted in an additional 11\textendash 39\% decrease in survival. We also created models relating habitat carrying capacity to streamflow and made projections for diversion and climate-change scenarios. Habitat carrying capacity estimated for diverted streamflows was 17\textendash 58\% lower than for undiverted streamflows. Climate-change scenarios resulted in additional decreases in carrying capacity for the dry (ECHO-G) climate model. Our results indicate climate change will likely pose an additional stressor that should be considered when evaluating the effects of anthropogenic actions on salmon population status. Thus, this type of analysis will be especially important for evaluating effects of specific actions on a particular species.},

  abstract = {In the past, moment and likelihood methods have been developed to estimate the effective population size (Ne) on the basis of the observed changes of marker allele frequencies over time, and these have been applied to a large variety of species and populations. Such methods invariably make the critical assumption of a single isolated population receiving no immigrants over the study interval. For most populations in the real world, however, migration is not negligible and can substantially bias estimates of Ne if it is not accounted for. Here we extend previous moment and maximum-likelihood methods to allow the joint estimation of Ne and migration rate (m ) using genetic samples over space and time. It is shown that, compared to genetic drift acting alone, migration results in changes in allele frequency that are greater in the short term and smaller in the long term, leading to under- and overestimation of Ne, respectively, if it is ignored. Extensive simulations are run to evaluate the newly developed moment and likelihood methods, which yield generally satisfactory estimates of both Ne and m for populations with widely different effective sizes and migration rates and patterns, given a reasonably large sample size and number of markers.},

  abstract = {We developed a predation index to describe the relative magnitude of predation on juvenile salmonids by northern squawfish Ptychocheilus oregonensis throughout the lower and middle Columbia River and lower Snake River. The predation index was the product of an abundance index and a consumption index. We evaluated various catch indices and found that catch per unit effort best reflected differences among northern squawfish abundances. Northern squawfish abundance was higher in the lower Columbia River than in the middle Columbia or lower Snake rivers and was highest in Bonneville Reservoir and the Columbia River downstream from Bonneville Dam. The consumption index was based on the concept of meal turnover time for a sample of northern squawfish. Variables needed to calculate the consumption index (CI) were water temperature (7), mean weight of the northern squawfish (IV), mean number of salmonids in each gut (5), and mean weight of the gut contents (GW): CI = 0.0209TL60-lV0-27-(S-GW-0-61). Generally, northern squawfishconsumption of juvenile salmonids was highest in tailraces downstream from dams and higher in the Columbia River than in the Snake River. Predation on juvenile salmonids was much higher in the lower Columbia River than in the middle Columbia or lower Snake rivers and was usually higher in summer than in spring. Predation was highest in the Columbia River downstream from Bonneville Dam and in John Day Reservoir. The predation index identified areas where predator control efforts can be most effective. Angling for northern squawfish at dams should be concentrated in tailraces. Removal efforts concentrated in the lower Columbia River would have the greatest effect on predation.},

  abstract = {Forty adult roundtail chub Gila robusta. captured by electronshing from the Colorado River in Colorado, were used to evaluate a nonlethal stomachpumping technique for recovering gut contents. Twenty roundtail chub were subjected to stomach pumping; another 20 were used as controls and not pumped. Gut contents were flushed from the anal vent instead of the buccal cavity, because the simple S-shaped gut and lack of a pyloric sphincter in roundtail chubs allowed the free passage of intestinal material. A necropsy revealed that the technique evacuated 100\%of gut contents, with no apparent damage to the pharyngeal teeth, esophagus, or intestinal lining. Long-term effects were not evaluated, but no short-term ill effects were observed. This technique is recommended as a safe, efficient, and nonlethal procedure for recovering gut contents of roundtail chub. The technique may also be applicable to the endangered humpback chub G. cypha and bonytail chub (7. elegans. closely-related species with nearly identical gut configurations and pharyngeal mills.},

  abstract = {Anthropogenic impacts on riverine systems have, in part, led to management concerns regarding the population status of species using these systems. In an effort to assess the efficacy of restoration actions, and in order to improve monitoring of species of concern, managers have turned to PIT (passive integrated transponder) tag studies with in-stream detectors to monitor movements of tagged individuals throughout river networks. However, quantifying movements in a river network using PIT tag data with incomplete coverage and imperfect detections presents a challenge. We propose a flexible Bayesian analytic framework that models the imperfectly detected movements of tagged individuals in a nested PIT tag array river network. This model structure provides probabilistic estimates of up-stream migration routes for each tagged individual based on a set of underlying nested state variables. These movement estimates can be converted into abundance estimates when an estimate of abundance is available for a location within the river network. We apply the model framework to data from steelhead (Oncorhynchus mykiss) in the Upper Columbia River basin and evaluate model performance (precision/variance of simulated population sizes) as a function of population tagging rates and PIT tag array detection probability densities within the river system using a simulation framework. This simulation framework provides both model validation (precision) and the ability to evaluate expected performance improvements (variance) due to changes in tagging rates or PIT receiver array configuration. We also investigate the impact of different network configurations on model estimates. Results from such investigations can help inform decisions regarding future monitoring and management.},

  abstract = {We collated smolt-to-adult return rate (SAR) data for Chinook salmon from all available regions of the Pacific coast of North America to examine the large-scale patterns of salmon survival. For consistency, our analyses primarily used coded wire tag-based (CWT) SAR estimates. Survival collapsed over the past half century by roughly a factor of three to ca. 1\% for many regions. Within the Columbia River, the SARs of Snake River populations, often singled out as exemplars of poor survival, are unexceptional and in fact higher than estimates reported from many other regions of the west coast lacking dams. Given the seemingly congruent decline in SARs to similar levels, the notion that contemporary survival is driven primarily by broader oceanic factors rather than local factors should be considered. Ambitious Columbia River rebuilding targets may be unachievable because other regions with nearly pristine freshwater conditions, such as SE Alaska and northern BC, also largely fail to reach these levels. Passive integrated transponder (PIT) tag-based SAR estimates available for Columbia River Basin populations are generally consistent with CWT findings; however, PIT tag-based SARs are not adjusted for harvest which compromises their intended use because harvest rates are large and variable. More attention is needed on how SARs should be quantified and how rebuilding targets are defined. We call for a systematic review by funding agencies to assess consistency and comparability of the SAR data generated and to further assess the implications of survival falling to similar levels in most regions of the west coast.},

  abstract = {Sea turtles nesting beaches are found near-globally, and the ability to characterize beaches by topographic and bathymetric features has remained largely out of reach. Twenty-one beaches and their offshore areas in southern Florida used by three sea turtle species (Caretta caretta, Chelonia mydas, and Dermochelys coriacea) were compared using topographic measures derived from LiDAR data. Variables such as slope, aspect, rugosity, and topographic and bathymetric position indices (TPI and BPI) were extracted from the LiDAR surface raster to characterize beaches used by sea turtles; stepwise multiple regression was used to determine which variables are most strongly associated with turtle nesting density. The three species exhibited tolerances for similar ranges of values in measured variables; beaches with values outside these tolerances were not used for nesting. Beach nesting density can be successfully modeled for all three species, but different topographic measures were important in each model. This work demonstrates the potential of high spatial resolution topographic datasets to successfully characterize coastal habitat for ecological applications.},

The results showed a decline in productivity irrespective of the model chosen and the way in which the pre- and postdam periods were defined. However, the data were noisy and the confidence bounds on parameter estimates were fairly large. To reconcile the different management goals derived from the different data sources (adult or juvenile data) or model choice (Ricker or Beverton\textendash Holt), we used simulation techniques and Bayesian algorithms. The combined approach suggests a recovery management goal (i.e., spawning stock associated with the maximum sustainable yield) of 60,000 steelhead above Lower Granite Dam. At current smolt-to-adult survival rates, the data indicate optimal escapement of between 20,000 and 27,000 adults. We note that Snake River steelhead stocks cannot be managed for recovery escapement levels given current estimates of smolt-to-adult survival rates, and we discuss alternatives for present-day management and rebuilding over time.},
